The Logistician also supplies the station with Raw Materials or ancillary materials if needed. Example: I assign a Pallet truck to station 2 which has an inventory of ancillary materials. This Pallet truck will therefore bring ancillary materials when this station needs them and will also take Finished goods from station 2 to bring them to station 3.

This system does not cause any problems as long as there are no perishable products or changeovers brought about by customer orders., For the FIFO system, we install dynamic racks that automatically bring down the products and allow us to retrieve the lowest products first, i.e. the oldest ones.
