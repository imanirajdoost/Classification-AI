"When doing a ""5 Whys"", what should you avoid or NOT do?"
Must go to the 5th why
Search for a cause
Search for a single cause
Search for multiple root causes
"In the context of a 5 Whys, it is possible to find several root causes. However, there is no point in trying to get to the 5th why if the root cause has already been found, nor in looking for a culprit."
"In a ""5 Whys"", what is the main rule to follow?"
Identify causes over which you can have control
Absolutely go to the 5th why
Absolutely stop at the 5th why
Identify cases that the team has experience with
"In the framework of a 5 Whys, if a root cause is external and impossible to control by the company (in the short or medium term), this cause is not useful to solve the problems. We will then look for another root cause."
Which of the following are MURI situations?
Work overload
Excessive demand
Lack of communication
Waiting time

What should be included on a Spaghetti Diagram?
The distance travelled by the product
The distance travelled by Logisticians
The corresponding flows
Product inventory by item
"On a Spaghetti Flow, we calculate the distance traveled by the product, by the people and we trace the corresponding flows. On the other hand, there is no need to show the inventory."
"The Spaghetti diagram is a mapping tool, as well as ..."
The Yamazumi
The Logigram
The VSM
The Kanban
The Kanban is not a mapping tool but a visual management tool.
A spaghetti diagram is useful for...

"Yes, a Spaghetti diagram is used for all these purposes."
My one-month Department rate is calculated as:
Orders delivered on time / Total orders delivered
Orders delivered late / Total orders delivered
Orders delivered late / Orders delivered on time
Total delay over one month / 30 days
The Department rate shows the % of orders delivered on time.
Calculate the Service rate: - number of orders delivered late: 12 - number of orders delivered on time: 24
67%
50%
33%
12%
Department rate = 24/(24+12)= 66%.
"The realized, negotiated, desired Service rates are discussed in this chronological order, with suppliers or customers."
TRUE
FALSE
"The Department rate desired by the client is then negotiated to be indicated on the contract. It is then compared with the realized rate which can be different, in + or -!"
What is the definition of Useful time?
Time when the machine is producing good parts at the nominal rate
Time when the machine is producing at the nominal rate
Time when the machine produces good parts at the actual rate
Time when the machine is producing at the actual rate
Useful time is the time spent producing good products at the nominal rate (or reference cycle time). TCR = reference cycle time / NPB = number of good parts
What factors affect the calculation of the OEE?
Availability
The performance
The quality
Batch Size
"OEE = actual production time / theoretical maximum production time. It therefore takes into account the availability of the machine and the Operators, and the performance of the process. The Batch Size is not directly taken into account in the calculation of the OEE."
What is the OEE of this machine?
approx. 75.2% of the total
approx. 80% of the total
approx. 50% of the total
approx 55% of the total
"OEE = Useful time / Time required Tu = 410x1' (minus the 40 bad pcs) To calculate the Time required we need to convert the 40 bad pcs (40x1') into minutes and add 60min of breakdown + 25min of SMED + 10min of adjustment. The Time required is therefore 410'+40'+60'+25'+10' = 545'. OEE = (410' / 545')x100 = 75,22%."
"On this machine, what are the load and availability rates?"
0.9166 and 0.909
0.95 and 0.77
0.95 and 0.84
0.84 and 0.77
"Load rate = Time required / Opening time i.e.: 8h-40mn breaks and Maintenance = 440' / 480' = 0.9166 Availability rate = Operating time / Time required i.e.: Tf = Tr-Panel, i.e. 440' - 40' (breakdown) = 400' Tr (see above) = 440' Availability rate = 400'/440' = 0.909"

The acronym MIFA stands for :
Main information flow analysis
Material and Information Flow Analysis
My Information For Analysis
Mean Instruction Flow Analysis
MIFA is a synonym for VSM
"In a process with a 20mn Takt, we have 5 process steps with the following cycle times and inventories (including work in progress) (see table) What is the process lead time (TTP)?"
828
1540
1128
990
TTP = (sum of outstanding amounts x Takt Time) = 77x20 = 1540 min

"In an insurance company, the lead time of a claim is defined as the time between :"
Receipt of a request for support and the visit of the expert to the customer
The client's entry into and exit from the facility
The visit of the expert and the reimbursement (or not) to the client
Entering the Queueing of the claim and closing the customer file (via a refund for example)
"Lead time is defined as the time it takes to go through a value chain or process. Here, the process is the handling of a claim. The lead time of the process must go from the entry of this assumption of responsibility in the Queueing until its exit and thus until the closing of the customer file."
What is the best way to improve a Flow in the Department world?
Improve activities Department by Department
Improve activities in all departments
Improve the Flow by activity
Improve by activity using a Kanban display
"To improve a Flow, it must be traced for all the Departments because we can miss the bottleneck and/or the most important waste and start to improve a Flow that is not a bottleneck which will have no impact"
"In a large Distribution store, how do you alert that an additional checkout is needed?"
This alert is not necessary
The store manager is the sole judge of this type of decision
"We put a trace on the ground to indicate the number of customers requiring 1, 2 or 3 checkouts"
We wait until the tail is long enough
"To avoid customer expectations, a visual signal is set up to detect the need or the problem (Jidoka). The visualization of the work in progress allows to set the right capacity, in order to respect the Delay (Little's law)"
The choice of the product family to be mapped is the first step of a VSM.
TRUE
FALSE
"It is indeed better to start with an ABC/fmr analysis which will allow to identify the products with the highest VA, thus those on which we will make a VSM in priority."
The Order Management team is complaining about the slow resolution of bugs in the in-house ordering software. What can we do about it?
I organize a meeting between the two departments
I organize an analysis of the process of taking into account the bugs
I look at external order management software
I ask the IT Department to speed up
Only a structured analysis (via a Yamazumi or a flowchart) of the process of taking into account and resolving bugs will make it possible to solve the problems.
"In a VSM, what information is useful to calculate the Lead time?"
Bottleneck workstation Throughput
Work in-process
The Takt Time
Time at VA and NVA
TTP in a VSM = (In-process x Takt Time) + (the sum of the Tcy). The Throughput of a process is equal to that of the Bottleneck workstation.
I have a problem with the processing time of my Customer Returns. What should I do?
I organize a VSM Workshop
I'm hiring an additional person in the Department
I organize a Workshop Problem solving
I organize a VOC (Voice of Customer) Workshop
"The VSM will allow to analyze the Customer Returns process from the customer's return to the resolution of his problem, which is a complete process in itself. This will allow to identify VA and NVA and to reduce the Lead time, the main indicator of a VSM."
What action(s) can be taken to CONTROL or limit work-in-process?
Set up a FIFO
Set up a Kanban
Implementing a 5S
Set up a Milk-run
"The Kanban allows to start the Manufacturing according to the customers needs and thus to limit the Work in-process. Similarly, the FIFO allows to control or limit the work-in-process thanks to a Manufacturing in the order of arrival of the Customer orders."
"Looking at the following image, what should I focus on first regarding my current VSM?"
The NVA of the workshop
The NVA shipping
The NVA in the relationship with the customer
The NVA of the billing process
I'm going to focus on the longest part of the process.
"On a production line, the VSM shows that certain positions are more or less occupied depending on the models manufactured. What should I do?"
Delete an item
Balancing the chain at Takt Time
Standardize the Mix product
Add an Operator on the Bottleneck workstation
"Balancing the chain at the Takt will allow us to meet the customer's expectations, which is essential. It will then be necessary to complete this study with a Red/Green analysis"
"Looking at the following image, what should I focus on first regarding my current VSM?"
The client
The Bottleneck workstation
Scheduling
The Commercial Department
"The sales department seems to be at the center of everything and interacts a lot, both with the customer and with internal departments. Its process seems to slow down the rest. So it is on this Department and its interactions with the outside that I will focus my attention."
What is the main reason for conducting the VSM as a team?
It's less complicated
One person cannot know the whole process
It takes less time
This makes it possible to find solutions on the spot
A current VSM is not about finding solutions. And no one is in a better position to describe the process than those involved in it.
"In a ""future or target state"" VSM, which Lean action can be retained?"
Replace the manager of the Department where the bottlenecks were detected
Train staff in the basics of Lean
Make a project assessment that demonstrates that the objectives have been achieved
Increase resources on all customer-facing workstations
"In order to achieve the target state of a VSM, a whole series of questions can be asked (7+1 questions method). Some actions called ""Kaizen"" can be of different natures such as staff training or the implementation of AIC, etc."
The cycle efficiency is equal to :
Sum of NVA times / Sum of cycle times
Sum of VA times / Sum of NVA times
Sum of VA times / Total Lead time
Sum of VA times / Sum of Cycle times

It includes three steps of 20 minutes of VA each and 3 hours of NVA, including one hour of mandatory NVA. A ""computer batch"" runs overnight (calculation and sending). The offices are open 8 hours a day. What is the Lead time of my process?"
620 minutes
260 minutes
1260 minutes
480 minutes
"The batch being the last step of my process (and thus the longest step), the validation (or not) of the collection can only be validated after 8 hours (receipt of funds) or 8*60' = 480min"

What is Full Kitting?
A method of supplying parts kits at the edge of the assembly line using automated carts
The same as kitting
A tool to eliminate waste
A tool to eliminate the need to supply at the station
"Full Kitting goes further than Kitting. It consists of delivering all the parts to a station (and not just certain parts). At PSA, where Full Kitting has been in use for several years, the parts required for each operation are transported by automated guided vehicles (AGVs) that are attached to magnetic strips on the floor and can be easily moved."
"In edge supply, in which case should we decide to create a kit?"
The consumption of the component is between 60% and 10% of cases
The consumption of the component is less than 10%.
The parts are bulky
There are no predefined cases
The kit system consists (in most cases) in delivering the least consumed parts. The most consumed parts will be delivered via a classic milkman

The distribution of fuel stops when the tank is full is a Poka Yoke.
The airbag that goes off when I have a Collision is a Poka Yoke.
The Poka Yoke is a system designed to prevent an error during a process involving a human. The airbag does not prevent a mistake but prevents injuries in a Collision. The light that comes on is an Andon.
What concept prevents human error in a process?
The Heijunka
The Andon
The Jidoka
The Poka Yoke
The Poka Yoke is a system designed to prevent an error during a process involving a human.
Can warehouse management software that guides Logisticians to get their jobs done as quickly and efficiently as possible be considered a Poka Yoke?
Yes
No
"Yes, but on condition that the Operator can only move on to the next task if the previous one has been validated by the software via barcodes for example"
"Yes, but on condition that the Operator can only move on to the next task if he has validated the previous task himself"
"Such software can act as a ""sequential"" Poka Yoke. For example, operators, through radio frequency terminals, follow the software instructions one after the other. The system tells them what to do step by step and the Operators have to confirm each action in order to receive further instructions. The next step can be considered validated both by the software via barcode for example and by the Operator for the phases without barcode."

Detecting device that prevents any error
Stop that prevents a mistake from being made
System that prevents moving on to the next task until the previous one is validated
Supply kit that prevents mistakes in the choice of parts
"The Poka Yoke can be classified into four types: Sequential: preserves an order or sequence of a process. If it is not respected, the work cannot be finished and, consequently, it is impossible to move on to the next process. Informative: gives clear, simple and direct information that helps to carry out operations without making mistakes. Grouped: proposes kits with all the material and parts necessary to carry out an operation in order to avoid errors. Physical: proposes constraints in the use in order to avoid errors. (e.g. no start-up if the door of the device is not properly closed)"
What are some ways that defects cannot be avoided?
Implement 100% control
Set up a control chart
Setting up a Poka Yoke
Carry out an FMEA
Only the Poka Yoke allows to avoid the defects in a radical way.
What is the purpose of an Andon?
To alert on the presence of anomalies
To prevent any defect
To prevent any breakdown
To test the correct operation of a process
Andon means lantern in Japanese. An Andon is a lighted warning system to locate quality problems or breakdowns in a production line.
What qualities does an Andon system have?
It solicits human judgment
It reduces defects
It makes production more reliable
It automatically stops the line in case of a fault
It is the Jidoka that advocates stopping the line in case of a defect. The idea is to stop production rather than risk producing bad parts.
What is Jidoka?
To stop production in case of bad parts
To be produced in just-in-time
To report production problems
To report machine breakdowns
The Jidoka consists in stopping a line in case of detection of a defect or a machine breakdown. It is about stopping the production rather than risking to produce bad parts.
What phrases characterize the Andon?
It must be visible or audible

Which of the following situations are detected by an Andon?
From overproduction
A defect
A change of operator required
A breakdown
Overproduction cannot be reported by an Andon because it does not correspond to an anomaly or a need for repair.
An FMEA allows to:
Improving the quality of the Department
Highlighting the risks of a Department
Visualize the waste of a Department
Visualize the criticality of a Department's failure
"The Failure Mode, Effects and Criticality Analysis (FMEA) is a tool for operational safety and quality management. The criticality of a failure mode is generally determined by the product (frequency index) × (severity index) × (detection index). These indices are defined by the customer, the company, which also sets a threshold of acceptability, above which any criticality must be reduced, by a means to be defined (redesign, maintenance plan, monitoring action...)."
What are the parameters that enter in the calculation of the Criticality of a failure mode?
Frequency index
Severity index
Detection index
Safety index
The Criticality of a failure mode is generally determined by the RPN (Risk Priority Number) which is the product (frequency index) × (severity index) × (detection index).
What does the acronym RPN stand for?
Risk Priority Number
Risk Potential Number
Ratio Priority Number
Rotation Priority Number
The RPN (Risk Priority Number) is the product (frequency index) × (severity index) × (detection index). The current RPN is to be compared with the target RPN after implementation of prevention measures. This indicator is the key element of a Failure Mode Analysis (FMEA)
"If you have a failure mode with a severity of 8, an occurrence of 7 and a detection of 2, on a scale of 10 for the 3 criteria, what is the criticality and what to do?"
RPN = 112; no action
RPN = 112; reduction to RPN = 100

"As a reminder, the SMED method is composed of 6 steps: 1- Measure the total time of changeover 2- Separate internal and external tasks 3- Switch internal tasks to external tasks 4- Decrease the time of internal tasks 5- Decrease the time of external tasks 6- Standardize the new process"
What is the objective of SMED:
Reduce Batch Size to reduce inventory and WIP without loss of Productivity or increase OEE of the equipment
Doing 5S on the equipment
Improve Productivity
Smooth out production to avoid frequent changes of activities
The SMED method has a direct impact on your performance (see OEE). To change series more efficiently will also allow you to optimize your production Batch Size and have a significant impact on your WIP and inventory (see EPEI method).
The target Batch Size to aim for should depend on:
"Production Capacity, SMED time and Customer Demand"
The size of the container we have
The Batch Size calculated by the Wilson formula
Batch Size = chgt time X 9
"In the EPEI method, 3 parameters are taken into account: Production Capacity (Cycle time - Tcy), SMED time, and Customer Demand (quantities to be delivered)"

I do not have all the necessary information
"A machine produces 3 references: ABC. The average daily demand is 100 A, 60 B and 35 C. Each part takes 2 minutes to produce, each changeover takes 1 hour. The machine runs 8 hours a day. What is the minimum Batch Size I am able to produce?"
Batch Size = 1. 1 piece flow is the most Lean solution
"Batch Size A=200, B=120, C=70"
"Batch Size A=100, B=60, C=35"
Batch Size = 540
"The EPEI method should be used here. Production time = (100+60+35) x 2' =390' Remaining time = (8x60') - 390' = 90' SMED time = 60' x 3 = 180' Batch size factor = 180 / 90 = 2. Therefore, multiply all TLs by 2!"

"1,50mn"
"0,68 mn"
"Takt Time = time available / Customer Demand ((8 x 60') - (30')) X 2 = 900' (per day) TT = (900 x 220) / (12000 x 12) = 1,37min"
"Considering two teams, 8 hours per day, 30 minutes of lunch break, 5mn of AIC, 5mn of 5S, 220 days worked per year, what is the takt time if the annual demand is 145000 elements ?"
"1,335min"
"1,365min"
0.749min
0.732min
"Takt Time = time available / Customer Demand ((8 x 60') - (30' - 5 - 5)) X 2 = 880' (per day) TT = (880 x 220) / 145000 = 1,335min"
"The ""Takt Time"" is :"
"Just another word for ""cycle time""."
The time elapsed between 2 products at the exit of the process to satisfy the Customer Demand
The time it would take one person to produce one unit of product or Department
"The ""Added Value"" component of Cycle time"
The Takt Time represents the ideal rhythm of piloting your production from the customer's point of view. It is also called the customer's Cycle time.
"My analysis shows that on this step of the process I have 19 minutes of VA, 4 minutes of incompressible NVA and 13 minutes of NVA. My Takt Time is 6 minutes. How many operators do I need?"
6
3
4
5
Formula no. of operators = (sum of VA &amp; NNVA) / TT - 19' + 4' = 23' -23' / 6' = 3.83 op (i.e. 4 operators)
3 Operators are working on an assembly line. (See the analysis on the picture) How to make sure that the Downstream Station is supplied on time?
I balance all the posts at 6 minutes
"I'm creating two 8-minute shifts, and cutting one Operator"
I am missing information
I delete the NVA
Here we need the target Takt Time to calculate a new organization and a new line layout
3 Operators are working on an assembly line. (See the analysis on the picture) How to make sure that the Downstream Station is supplied on time?
I balance all the posts at 6 minutes
I add an Operator
I delete an operator
I create two 6-minute shifts (VA+NVA unavoidable) and balance the third shift with provisioning or supervision tasks.
Formula no. of operators = (sum of VA &amp; NVA) / TT - (3' + 1') + (6)' + (5' + 1)' = 16' -16' / 6' = 2.67 op (i.e. 3 operators) I therefore have stations 2 and 3 at 6 min from Tcy + station 1 at 4'.

1 piece every 20 seconds
1 piece every 50 seconds
1 piece every 100 seconds
1 piece every 135 seconds
"Takt Time = time available / Customer Demand (2 x 7h x 5 x 4 weeks) x 3600 = 1 008 000 sec TT = 1 008 000 / 20 000 = 50,4 sec"
"In the following process, the Takt time is 32s, the flow is managed in just-in-time with a delayed customization... At which stage should we favour a FIFO flow compared to Kanban?"
Never
At all stages
From step 4
After step 7
"Wherever the Flow is common (common part or sub-assembly) FIFO should be preferred. As soon as the process is differentiated, then the implementation of Kanban will be mandatory"
The FIFO method allows to:
Scheduling production according to a given rate
Optimizing Workstation Loads
Limit the production of a job to the exact needs of the next job

that they are on the Work in-process inventory on the item
that they are on containers in the process of being consumed by the downstream station
that the product requirement is covered
to launch a new production
"The Kanban board is a representation of the total possible inventory between 2 production steps. If all the cards are on the board, it means that the inventory is empty. On the other hand, if no cards are on the board, it means that the inventory is at its maximum level and therefore no production is needed."
What are the main solutions to control and manage a work-in-process?

"To remember the 7 types of waste, use the acronym DAMNESS = ""Unnecessary Travel, Waiting, Unnecessary Movement, Non-Quality, Unnecessary Work in-process/Stocks, Overproduction, Overprocessing"" or the acronym TIMWOOD in English (Transport, Inventory, Motion, Waiting, Overproduction, Overprocessing, Defects)"
When is it useful to implement a Lean approach?
When you have just created your company
When everything is going well in the company
When nothing goes right in the company
When the company went bankrupt
The best time to implement a lean approach is as soon as possible!
If I don't do a business performance diagnostic:
I may be implementing the wrong changes
I will be punished by the great God of Lean...
I won't know where the waste is
I save time to implement improvements
A diagnosis is ESSENTIAL before starting a lean workshop.
"If I want to relocate my Factory's Workstations, I must arrange for:"
Product transport flows do not cross
The positions are placed in the order of the production steps
"They are each in a different place, so as not to disturb the others"
There are as many Crossings as possible
Relocation can be a costly operation. It's best to think carefully before taking the plunge!
Which company is at the origin of the main principles of lean?
MIT in 1987
Toyota in 1970
Motorola in 1980
Tesla in 2005
"It was Toyota who invented Lean, after the 2nd World War, with the Toyota Production System. MIT theorized it."
"A good Lean Leader must know, among other things:"
"Communicate with teams, go to the field, and align improvement actions with the company's vision"
Choose the right objectives for the company and implement improvement actions
Always prioritize actions related to Safety and Well-being at work
Always prioritize quality-related actions
"A good Lean Leader is a Leader who implements improvement actions by prioritizing the Safety and Well-being of employees. To do this, he/she must work with the teams in the field."
What statement does not characterize the Lean approach?
Standardizes the activity
Eliminates waste
Accelerates flows
Automates manual tasks
"Automating manual tasks may be the conclusion of a Lean Workshop, but it is not...automatic!"
What is the Main goal of the Six Sigma approach?
Apply statistical tools
Manage a project according to a specific method
Reduce the variability of the process studied
Improve the profitability of the manufactured product
"Lean Six Sigma was invented with the advent of electronics and focuses on reducing ""leakage"" in a process."
What is JIT (Just in Time)?
Produce the quantity requested by the customer
Produce the quality requested by the customer
Produce in the time frame requested by the customer
The other 3 answers
"JIT is also called ""Just-in-time"", ""5 zeros"" or ""zero delay"". The five zeros correspond to ""zero breakdowns"", ""zero delays"", ""zero paper"", ""zero inventory"" and ""zero defects""."
What is the Main goal of the Lean approach?
Identify waste in the process studied
Lead a Workshop on a specific perimeter
Improve the performance of the process under study
Improve the quality of manufactured products
The objective of lean is of course to improve performance. And to do it continuously!
Lean will focus on removing :
Absenteeism
Unnecessary tasks
Quality control
The meetings
And this through the hunt for the 7+1 types of waste: DAMNESS + waste of human skills.
The DMAIC method allows:
Improve an existing process
To create a new process
To design a new product
To draw a strategic vision
"The DMAIC is composed of 5 successive phases: Define, Measure, Analyze, Innovate/Improve, Control. It is a useful methodology to carry out a continuous improvement project."
Who invented the word Lean?
Tesla
Toyota
Womack and Jones
Tchaikovsky
"Toyota invented the main principles of lean. Then the word and the philosophy of lean were created in the United States in the 1990s, and popularized by the book Lean Thinking (1996) by James P. Womack and Daniel T. Jones."
Which statement is false? The DMAIC method...
Contains 5 mandatory phases
Is a project management method
Includes 5 successive phases
Necessarily uses statistical methods
"The use of statistical methods is the prerogative of lean six sigma, which can be foreseen in the Measurement phase of a DMAIC, but not necessarily."
When does DMAIC apply?
To solve a specific problem
To improve an existing process
To design a new process
To improve the ROI of a project
DMAIC (Define Measure Analyse Improve Control) is a problem solving method used in Lean Six Sigma projects but can also be applied to Lean projects.
"What is the overall objective of the ""Define"" phase of a DMAIC?"
Define a problem and the scope of work
Define the gains made by the project
Define the performance of the process to be studied
Define which project approach to apply
"The Define phase consists in defining the problem, the scope of the study and the associated Objectives (in terms of performance, user expectations, etc.)."
"What is the overall objective of the ""Measure"" phase of a DMAIC?"
Measure the performance of the process to be improved
Measure the performance of the improved process
Measure the size of the project
Measuring the company's performance
"The ""Measure"" phase consists of selecting the Indicators that need to be analyzed and implementing the corresponding data collection."
"What is the overall objective of the ""Analyze"" phase of a DMAIC?"
Analyze the potential gain of the project
Analyze the main cause of poor performance
Analyze the modified process
Analyze the process to identify the causes of its lower performance
"The ""Analyze"" phase consists of assessing the gaps between the current situation and the Objectives set and identifying the causes and the levers that can be used to remedy them."
In DMAIC the I corresponds to :
Initiate
Involve
Innovate
Integrate
"The notion of improving is associated with innovating. Moreover, in English, the I means: improve"
What type of employee/company partner should have the Yellow Belt level?
An Operator working on the process to be improved
The chartered accountant
A supplier of the company
The pilot of the plane
"The ""Yellow Belt"" knows the strategic stakes of the method, participates in the operational phases and may be required to support the project as a sponsor."
Which of the following is not a DMAIC activity?
Designing a new product
Characterize the process
Define and formulate the project team's commitment
Translate customer expectations into measurable requirements
"The DMAIC method is applied to problem solving, not to the creation of new products."
At the end of DMAIC phases D or M you must stop the project if:
The potential gains are insufficient
The problem is too complex
You don't want to continue
No solution has been identified
But don't let that stop you from starting up a DMAIC again and looking for possible improvements!
Lean six sigma is essentially about:
Improve an existing process and reduce its variability
Create a new process
Reduce waste in a process
Improve the quality of the manufactured product
"Six Sigma or 6 Sigma is a trademark of Motorola designating a structured management method aimed at improving the quality and efficiency of processes. Lean 6 Sigma is a mix of lean and 6 Sigma which consists of improving a process and reducing variability, i.e. potential product defects."
"To start a Lean process, you must :"
Relocation of Factory positions after making a Spaghetti diagram
Identify the Non-Value Added (NVA) points and then set improvement objectives

Fake
The Lean diagnosis is done visually and collectively. It is by involving everyone that we can gather the most relevant information to make a useful diagnosis.
"Ideally, at what stage of a process should a red-green analysis be performed?"
On each step of the process
On the Manufacturing step(s) only

"What is the ""Takt Time"" of this company? Objectives: 12 drones to be manufactured per minute"
5 drones / second
5 seconds / drone
12 drones / minute
Data is missing to calculate the Takt Time
"Takt Time = time available / Customer Demand, i.e. 60 sec / 12 drones = 5 sec / drone."
"What is the ""Takt Rate"" of this company? Objectives: 12 drones to be manufactured per minute"
"0,2 drone / second"
5 seconds / drone
12 drones / minute
Data is missing to calculate the Takt Rate
"Takt Rate = Customer Demand / time available, i.e. 12 drones / 60sec = 0,2 drone / sec or 12 drones / 1min"
What type of flow is described by this VSM?
Push Flow
Pull Flow
The checkered arrows represent a 100% Push Flow in the VSM standards. A Pull Flow would be represented by a Kanban icon and a FIFO (First In First Out) inventory control
Calculate the Lead time of this Process: Takt Time = 5 sec/drone and Throughput = 11 drones/min (Click on the image for more information if needed)
8 min
4 min
2 min
There is a lack of data to calculate the TTP
"TTP = Work in-process/ Throughput (2+20+3+9+1+6+1+3= 45 /11) = 4min and we can also calculate the TTP with the help of the Takt Time, the inventories and the Cycle times: (sum of the work in-process x Takt Time) + (sum of the cycle times of the stations), that is to say here: (2+20+3+9+1+6+1+3= 45) x 5 + (1+2+3+4+5=15) = 240 sec (4min)"
Calculate the Flow Tension Ratio (FTR) of this process (Takt Time = 5sec/drone)
"0,062 %"
"7,5 %"
"6,25 %"
There is a lack of data to calculate the FTR
"The formula for calculating the RTF is (Sum of the Cycle times / TTP) x 100% or here ((1+2+3+4+5) / 240) x 100% = 6.25% It is necessary to use the Takt Time (TT) to calculate the TTP (sum of the inventories X TT plus the sum of the cycle times) of the process, before being able to calculate the RTF."
Which item has the most inventory waiting upstream?
Station 1: Cutting
Station 2 : Stamping
Station 5 : Painting
There is no inventory upstream of the stations!
This pile of inventory at the exit of station 1 is perhaps due to the fact that the Logisticians do not pass by often enough!
Which item has the slowest Throughput in this process?
Station 3 : Cutting
Station 5 : Painting
Station 2 : Stamping
Item 4: Assembly
"Calculation of the actual throughputs: P1 = (60sec/1sec)x18% = 11d/min, P2 = 30d x18% = 5.4d/min, P3 = 20d x37% = 7.4d/min, P4 = 15d x34% = 5d/min, P5 = 12d x35% = 4.2d/min. Therefore, P5 is the slowest throughput station. It is perhaps the bottleneck! To be verified by a field observation..."
My customer wants a Delay (or TTP = Lead time of the process) as close to 2 min as possible - What is the maximum Work in-process I should have on my entire process to meet this delay? (Production objective: 12 drones per minute).
30 drones
24 drones
40 drones
10 drones
"Little's law must be used here: TTP = Work in-process / Throughput. In a VSM, the Takt rate corresponds to the global objective Flow of the process. Work in-process = TTP x Throughput i.e., (2min x60sec) x 0.2sec = 24 drones maximum - Be careful to use the same time units!"
What is the current throughput of this production line? TTP = 4min Work in-process = 45 drones
"11,25 drones / min"
13 drones / min
45 drones
4 drones / min
"We must use Little's law here: WIP = Work in-process / Throughput - Throughput = WIP / WIP i.e., 45 drones / 4min = 11.25 drones/min"
What is the actual throughput of this item over 1 min?
2 drones / sec
30 drones / min
5.4 drones / min
18 drones / min
"Perfect (or theoretical) cycle time = 2sec / drone - Since this station only works at 18% of its capacity (indicator: % tps occupied), its theoretical capacity is : 60 sec / 2 = 30 drones max / minute. Its actual throughput is therefore : 18% of 30 drones, or 5.4 drones / min."

What is the formula for calculating Little's law
Lead time = Work in-process / Throughput
Lead time = Work in-process / Cycle time
Throughput = Delay x Inventory
Lead time = Work in-process x Throughput
Little's law was invented by John Little in the 1960s. Its principle is the following: the Lead time of a product is equal to the Work in-process divided by the Throughput of the production process.
Lowering the work in-process has the effect of :
Increase the time products spend in the production process
Reduce quality defects
Limit the risk of Collision
Reduce the time products spend in the production process
"Just like on the highway when you arrive at a tollbooth, the less people there are, the shorter the waiting time (or Lead time)!"
Little's law allows us to measure...
the flow (or lead time) of a product in a process
the ideal manufacturing rate desired by the customer
Little's law formula: Lead time = Outstanding / Throughput
What does the Theory of Constraints say?
That every process has a step with more Throughput than the others
That any process has a step with less throughput than the others
The Theory of Constraints says that the Flow of a process is always limited by at least one bottleneck.
"To improve the performance of a production line, it is better to..."
Improving bottleneck performance
"First, review the layout of the stations"
Reduce small waste throughout the process
Reduce the biggest waste first
To reduce the lead time of a product you must first :
Reduce transportation time
Reduce quality defects
Limit the risk of Collision
Reduce work in-process
"Just like on the highway when you arrive at a tollbooth, the less people there are, the shorter the waiting time (or Lead time)!"
If I don't do a business diagnosis:
I may be implementing the wrong changes
It will do itself
I won't know where the waste is
I'll get a slap on the wrist from {[TEACHER_NAME]}

What does Takt Time mean?
The rate expected by the customer
The sum of the VA of a process
The sum of the NVA of a process
The time of passage of a product in a process
"If the Takt Time of a process is 20 minutes, it means:"
That the average cycle time at the fastest station is 20 minutes
That the average cycle time at the slowest station is 20 minutes
That the Lead time seen by the customer is 20 minutes
"Ideally, 20 minutes should elapse between 2 deliveries to the customer"
"What is the MAIN contribution of the ""VSM""?"
Detect variations (e.g. in processing times)
"Identify the process value flow, quantify Added Value and Non-Value Added, identify bottlenecks"
Determine the lead time of the process
Identify process operators' movements and inventory at each station
What is the % of NVA if the Lead time is 46 minutes and the Added Value time is 22 minutes?
15%
52%
48%

A method of production cost analysis associated with the cost analysis
A method of classifying products in chronological order
Segmentation of products according to their cost price
"According to Pareto's law or ABC analysis or 20/80 law, in most cases, 20% of the Manufacturing products represent 80% of the total value of the inventory. So it is on these that we will focus our attention. The ABC/fmr matrix adds a dimension of production frequency or customer demand: f for frequent, m for medium and r for rare."

What phases has the industrial world gone through over time?
"Craft, mass production, agile production (Lean)"
"Mass production, Lean production, crafts"
"Handicraft, mass production, custom production"
"Customized production, craftsmanship, agile production"
"The 3 phases through which companies have gone are: craft, mass production and Lean or Agile production, in response to a supply that is stronger than demand and to a change in consumption (cost, quality and Delay). Lean arrived with the expectation of personalization from consumers."
"Chronologically, what were the 3 key factors of differentiation of the companies?"
Cost then Quality then Delay
Delay then Quality then Cost
"After the 2nd World War (1945) supply is lower than demand, Productivity is king. 1970's: The balance between supply and demand stabilizes, quality becomes necessary to differentiate. Nowadays, Delay, quality and cost are the 3 criteria of choice for customers in an environment where supply is higher than demand."
"To start a Lean process, you must :"

All are important
Overproduction amplifies other waste.
The Lean philosophy applies above all :
To all departments in the company
In production
To Production and Departments
To the Customer
"Lean applies to every department in the company. If one department is not lean, it is likely to slow down the entire company."
"In the lean office world, Takt Time is :"
The time it takes a customer to decide to place an order
The ideal Processing of a file considering the time spent by the Departments
The time it takes for a file to reach the Department
The ideal processing time of a file to respond to a Customer Demand
The proper assignment of staff to departments allows:
to drip a Department
to create a good atmosphere in the departments
No good atmosphere if the Department is under pressure! Both answers are therefore correct...even if the first one precedes the second...
"The 8 wastes of the ""lean office"" are :"
Exactly the same as Lean manufacturing = DAMNESS
"Travel (unnecessary), Waiting, Micromovement (poor office ergonomics), Non-Quality, Work in-process/Inventory (of files), Over-processing/Processing (unnecessary), Over-production/Disorganization, Wasted intelligence"
"Disorganization, Stress, Non-training, Bad relationships, Unhappy customers"
"unnecessary printing, unnecessary packaging, disposable markers, plastic cups, tissues, unnecessary air conditioning..."
The 8 wastes of lean office are just the transposition of the 8 wastes of manufacturing. But in DAMNESS there are only 7 types of waste and the most important one is missing: the waste of human intelligence. The 2nd answer is therefore the most accurate.
The versatility of employees is important because it allows:
Move certain tasks from one Department to another
To avoid routine
Reduce personnel costs
That all employees are interchangeable
"Multi-skilling is often an asset in a company because it makes it easier to absorb periods of overload and avoid problems related to the departure or absence of an employee. It can also be a way to avoid routine. But this does not mean that everyone knows or should know how to do the same thing! Specialization, according to the skills and desires of each person, should also be favored."
Listening to the customer is fundamental because it can allow :
to know the customer's expectations
to know his opinion on our product
to know his opinion on the competition
to improve its product (problem solving)
Listening to customers is fundamental. It must be at the center of the company. This is the 1st principle of lean!
Over-quality is:
The quality that the customer wants but that we can't achieve
Quality that is not necessary to satisfy the customer
The part of the quality that the customer does not want to pay for
The part of the quality that the customer is willing to pay for
Over-quality can lead to unnecessary costs and delays that impact the company and the customer.
"The ""agile"" methods are :"
A concept close to lean
Methods used in the computer world
Practices reserved for experts
Lean applied to the world of gazelles
"Agile methods were born with the Agile manifesto, written in 2001, which consecrates the term ""agile"" to refer to multiple existing methods. They are practices of piloting and realization of projects especially data-processing. They are based on an iterative, incremental and adaptive development cycle."
"Contrary to lean manufacturing, the lean office consists in studying tasks and not processes"
TRUE
FALSE
"Lean office is about improving flows and processes, just like lean manufacturing"
"Before doing a lean office Workshop, no need to do a gemba because..."
Everyone talks to each other at the coffee machine
Office workers are good communicators
It's best to get everyone together in the meeting room
"Of course you can, you have to make a gemba!"
The gemba is just as important in the office as in manufacturing. Employees do not say the same thing when questioned individually and collectively. The individual dimension of the gemba is fundamental.
A constraint in a Flow is also called...
A waiting area
A cap
An inventory
A spout
The method of identifying a bottleneck is called the Theory of Constraints.

(Sum of inventory x Takt time) / Sum of time at NVA
Sum of inventory / Bottleneck workstation cycle time
Sum of time at VA + (sum of work in-process and inventory x Takt time)
Sum of time at VA / (sum of inventory x Takt time)
"In a VSM, to calculate the Lead time, we take the total time at VA and add it to the work-in-process multiplied by the Takt Time. Raw Materials and Finished goods inventories are added to the WIP according to the scope of the Lead time we want to study."
What is the Process Lead time (PLT) below - Output Throughput = 700 units/week - Added Value time = 45 minutes/unit - Number of units in the process = 2800 - Buyer efficiency = 75%.
3.96 weeks
4 weeks
4.5 weeks
2.75 weeks
"The formula for Little's law should be used here, i.e. TTP = outstanding / Throughput. TTP = 2,800 / 700 = 4 weeks"
"My parts go through three successive imperfect processes. The first process has an OEE of 90%, the second has an OEE of 99% and the third has an OEE of 87%. The overall OEE of the process is :"
(0.9 x 0.99 x 0.87) x 100
"(0,9 + 0,99 + 0,87) x 100"
90 x 99 x 87 /1000

"The total duration, from the first good piece of a series to the last good piece"
The time it takes to set up a line and start production of a new product family
"The time from the last good part of a run to the first good part of the next run, at the nominal rate"

What is the FIRST reason to implement a Work-in-process control system?
to reduce costs
to reduce lead time
to reduce work-in-process
to stabilize the process
"The first goal of a work-in-process control system is to stabilize the process (and therefore, the lead time). Subsequently, and depending on the company's Objectives, the work-in-process can be reduced (improvement of customer Delays and reduction of storage costs)."
What are the main solutions to control and manage a work-in-process?
Increase the number of operators
Set up a FIFO management
Set up a call signal between each operation
Doing a 5S project
"To limit the work in-process between each step, we will use: - a management of the work in-process in FIFO (First In First Out) - the implementation of a call system between each step (Kanban)."
What are the benefits of a SMED method?
Increased lead time
Work in-process reduction
Increase in the Factory's Level of Service
Increase of the Batch Size
The SMED method also allows to improve the performance of the machine (OEE and/or GEE).
"In a SMED approach, we consider 2 types of tasks, which ones?"
Ancillary and induced tasks
Internal and external tasks
"The internal tasks require that the process is stopped (change the tooling, adjust it,...) contrary to the external tasks which can be done while the machine is running (bring the next material, supply the new tooling,...)."
What does EPEI stand for?
Every Part Every Interface
Every Part Every Interval
Every Process Every Interval
Every Part Every Input
EPEI stands for Every Part Every Interval. It is a calculation method to determine the smallest possible Batch Size in a process with Mix product. It consists of being able to deliver all the quantities requested by the customer and using all the production time available. This is equivalent to devoting all the excess capacity of a machine to changeover.
When do we say that a manufacturing line integrates the Mix product?
When Manufacturing products from other products
When one of its Workstations is only working from time to time
When manufacturing several products at the same time
When manufacturing different products
"A manufacturing line integrates Mix product when it is able to manufacture different products or different references, colors, shapes of products."
The FIFO management of a work-in-process consists in...
respect the order in which the products are taken: last in first out
respect the order in which the products are taken: first in first out

What are the steps that correspond to a SMED approach?
Define internal and external tasks
Transform internal tasks into external tasks
Transforming External tasks into Internal tasks
Increase time for external tasks
The 6 steps of a SMED method are: 1. Measure total changeover time 2. Separate internal tasks from external tasks and anticipate these external tasks 3. Reduce the duration of internal tasks 5. Reduce the duration of external tasks 6. Standardize the new process
The EPEI method is calculated with the following elements:
Logistic batch sizes and production time available to perform Changeovers
Logistic batch sizes and Changeover times
Changeover times and time available to perform changeovers
"To change series, Cycle time and Batch Size"
"The EPEI corresponds to the possible rate of changeover in a manufacturing line. It is expressed in time. EPEI = sum of the changeovers for each product manufactured on a given machine / time available on this machine to make this changeover. The time available to make the changeover is calculated using the machine occupancy time, i.e. Cycle time x Batch Size."
The Kanban allows....
Reduce inventory and avoid supply shortages
To reduce the flow time in a Push Flow
To visually manage the production

The green zone indicates the quantity of physical inventory available
What is not a valid dimensioning data for the green zone?
The frequency of periodic replenishment is fixed
A Delay factor determined by the buffer profile of the item
A minimum order quantity
The variability of the article's replenishment delays

Which statement is true for the equation of Free Flow in Ddmrp and Free Inventory in MRP?
"There are no allocations on the inventory, coming from planned orders"
Schedules recommended supply orders
Includes physical inventory

Which assertion does not match a runtime alert in Ddmrp?
Peak order alert indicates a need for replenishment
The physical inventory alert indicates when physical inventory is too low
Material and component timing alert indicates potential breaks in order release
Delay alerts engage planners and buyers to report on outstanding orders of managed items via a Delay Buffer
"In the execution phase of the Ddmrp, the use of buffer alerts leads to a change of 2 paradigms. Which ones ?"
Execute operations by buffer level Criticality rather than by due date and decouple forecasts from replenishment order generation
Locate the position of the physical inventory by color in the buffer instead of the state of the available inventory and use the decoupled explosion
Execute operations by buffer level Criticality rather than by due date and incorporate only qualified orders instead of planned orders
Locate the position of the physical inventory by color in the buffer instead of the status of the available inventory and execute by criticality of the buffer level instead of the due dates

Yamazumi serves:
to eliminate the NVA in a process
to balance the tasks between departments
to identify the bottleneck department
to bring together departments that have a lot of interaction
"Instead, the Spaghetti diagram will identify the need to bring together Departments that have a lot of interaction with each other."
A swimlane or flow analysis:
shows the tasks or functions of an entire company
links the tasks or functions of a process across multiple departments
stacks tasks or functions by Department
shows the tasks or functions of a single Department
A swimlane shows the tasks or functions of each person in a given process. The stacked version of this process analysis is called a Yamazumi or process map.
Performance management rituals are there to:
improve communication within a team
verify that the team's Objectives are met
do problem solving
evaluate the performance of employees
Never do problem solving during Management rituals and especially during short interval animations. Reserve this for specific meetings.
What is the name of the room where all the indicators and tables useful to the company are displayed?
The Obeya
The Poka Yoke
The obeya is also known as the Command Room or Pilot Room. It allows to put forward all the key projects of the company
(Reminder) The 5 principles of Lean are:
"Putting the customer at the center, eliminating waste, Tightening its flows, using collective intelligence, continuous improvement"
"Putting the customer at the center, eliminating waste, relocating suppliers, using collective intelligence, continuous improvement"
"Putting the customer at the center, driving out non-quality, Tightening its flows, using collective intelligence, continuous improvement"
"Putting the customer at the center, eliminating waste, Tightening its flows, using collective intelligence, freezing processes"

An internal customer is :
a customer who shares the company's premises
a department of the company for which we provide services
Support departments often have internal customers.
The internal customer is more important than the external customer
TRUE
FALSE
"The satisfaction of external or final customers, those who purchase the company's Finished goods or services, must remain in the line of sight of all employees! Even if they are sometimes never in direct contact with them."
Departments that primarily have internal customers are:
Production
The Design Office
Purchasing
The legal
Production has Logistic as an internal customer but its work is primarily for the external customer.
"The D of DAMNESS in the Lean Office, corresponds:"
inefficient splitting of processes between different stakeholders
to the remoteness of departments that are often in relation
defects and errors in the input of information
slow access to the servers
The D of DAMNESS corresponds to unnecessary moves including inefficient task splitting that slows down processes.
"The A of DAMNESS corresponds in the Lean Office, for example:"
waiting for computer troubleshooting by the IT Department
awaiting validation of a decision by management
waiting for the supplier's response to a request for a quote
Waiting for the customer's response to the submission of an estimate
The A of DAMNESS corresponds to the unnecessary expectations. The customer's Delay is not controllable by the company and is not part of the Waiting waste to be chased.
"The M of DAMNESS corresponds in the Lean Office, for example:"
the making of unnecessary photocopies
poor software ergonomics
to the poor quality of an office chair
poor office lighting
The M of DAMNESS corresponds to unnecessary movements related to usability or interface problems.
"The N of DAMNESS corresponds in the Lean Office, for example to :"
obtain clarification of information received because it is incomplete
shipping the wrong products to the customer because of illegible handwriting
move to the coffee machine
recruiting an unsuitable person for a position
"The N of DAMNESS corresponds to Non-Quality. Moving to the coffee machine is not part of the Non-Quality waste, but possibly of the Movement or Displacement waste."
"The E of DAMNESS corresponds in the Lean Office, for example:"
storage of unnecessary data and information
storage of office supplies in a building far from the Department
to orders pending entry
meetings that pile up in the employees' agenda
The E of DAMNESS corresponds to Work in-process in excess and thus does not concern the meetings too numerous
"The 1st S of DAMNESS corresponds in the Lean Office, for example:"
the development of a 50-year strategic plan
detailed meeting minutes that are never read
to indicators that are never reported on
to insufficiently trained employees
The 1st S of DAMNESS corresponds to Overproduction. Under-trained employees correspond to the 8th waste of Lean: Under-utilization of talents
"The 2nd S of DAMNESS corresponds in the Lean Office, for example:"
to Meetings that lead to endless digressions
copying unnecessary people in emails
omissions in the transmission of information
the absence of delegation
The 2nd S of DAMNESS corresponds to over-processing or unnecessary treatments often linked to the absence of standards.
The 8th waste of Lean corresponds for example:
lack of delegation
the lack of visual management
lack of training
to an excess of relaxation breaks
"The 8th waste of Lean is the under-utilization of team members' talents. Excessive relaxation breaks can be a sign of problems, but without knowing the cause, we cannot say that it is related to a lack of use of talents!"
"To identify all the waste in an Office process, we often perform :"
a VSM
a flow analysis or Swimlane
a spaghetti diagram
an Ishikawa diagram
"The Ishikawa diagram allows to identify the causes-effects of a problem but not all the wastes of a process. On the other hand, the VSM or the flow analysis (or swimlane) allow, at different levels of precision, to identify the wastes of a process. The Spaghetti diagram is primarily used to identify transport waste, not ALL waste."
The Yamazumi allows :
identify all the tasks of a multi-department process
identify VA and NVA tasks
to chase the NNVA
balance tasks and flows
"The NNVA is an NVA that is necessary for the company. It cannot be removed, even if the customer does not wish to pay for this NNVA."
"In a Yamazumi, each Department is represented:"
By a stack of tasks with the 1st one at the bottom of the stack
By a pile of tasks with the 1st one on top of the pile
By a taskbar with the 1st one on the left
By a taskbar with the 1st one on the right
Each Department is represented by a task stack whose height is proportional to the time spent on each task.
"In a Yamazumi, an NNVA task is usually colored in :"
orange
green
Green is usually the color of the VA.
"In a Yamazumi, tasks are represented as rectangles proportional to their importance."
TRUE
FALSE
The tasks are represented as rectangles proportional to their duration. A 3 minute task will be 3 times higher than a 1 minute task.
The Yamazumi is used to analyze tasks:
of a Workstation
of a process
"The Yamazumi is used to analyze the VA, NVA and NNVAE of a process as a whole, since it is a tool for balancing jobs. Thus, if a workstation is overloaded and therefore bottlenecked in relation to the other workstations, we will try to eliminate the NVAs and then reallocate, or rebalance the work by giving tasks from the bottleneck workstation to the other workstations."
A swimlane or office flow analysis:
shows the tasks or functions of an entire company
links the tasks or functions of a process
stacks tasks or functions by Department
shows the tasks or functions of a single Department
A swimlane shows the tasks or functions of each person in a given process. The stacked version of this process analysis is called a Yamazumi or process map.
Synonyms for swimlane are:
flowchart
progress analysis
yamazumi
MRP
"measure the time of internal tasks, analyze internal tasks, transform internal tasks into external tasks"
"In a flow analysis, Added Value operations are typically represented as:"
by a circle symbol
by a square symbol
"VA tasks are represented by a circle, the square usually represents the control phases."
"In a flow analysis, the transport phases are generally represented:"
with an arrow
by a triangle
"The transport tasks are represented by an arrow, the triangle corresponds to the storage or retrieval function."
"In a flow analysis, the control phases are generally represented:"
by a square
by a looping arrow
by a circle
by a triangle
"The control tasks are represented by a square, the triangle corresponds to the storage or retrieval function and the round to a VA operation."
"In a flow analysis, waiting phases are usually represented by a symbol that looks like :"
a capital A
a capital D
The waiting phases are represented by a round square that looks like a capital D.
"In a flow analysis, the storage/retrieval phases are typically represented by:"
a triangle
a square
The triangle is used to symbolize storage/retrieval. The square corresponds to the control phases.
A flow analysis is primarily used to:
detect NVA tasks
Calculate employee Well-being Indicators
Detecting tasks at VA
detect tasks that can be reassigned to other departments
The swimlane is a flow chart or analysis used to detect VA and NVA tasks in a flow. The Yamazumi is a cross-departmental process map with stacks of tasks per department and allows for the smoothing of the flow via the reduction of the NVA and the reassignment of tasks from the bottleneck department to other departments.
The flow analysis is a mapping focused on a process:
TRUE
FALSE
The mapping of several Departments will be done by a VSM type analysis
The Swimlane and the Yamazumi are deployed according to the PDCA and DMAIC methods:
TRUE
FALSE
We will use one or the other of the 2 methods to build our swimlane or our yamazumi.
What is a series?
"Production of products of the same reference, without stopping production"
"The inventory of products of the same reference, placed in the same place"
"A series is the production of a quantity of products of the same reference, without stopping production"
Changeover time is :
the time needed to move from one series to another
Time to change production machines for a given series
To change series is the time it takes to move from one series to another from the last good part of series A to the first good part of series B.
SMED is often translated into French as :
Tool change in less than 10 minutes
Tool change in less than 1 minute
"One minute is a bit ambitious even if it is the literal translation of the English: Single Minute! The ""SMART"" objective is to succeed in reconfiguring a production in less than 10 minutes."
The SMED method includes 6 key steps. The first 3 are:
"measure SMED time, separate internal and external tasks, transform internal tasks into external tasks"
"measure the time of internal tasks, analyze internal tasks, transform internal tasks into external tasks"
"measure SMED time, separate internal and external tasks, transform external tasks into internal tasks"
"measure the time of External tasks, analyze the External tasks, transform the External tasks into Internal tasks"
"The SMED method is based on a classic DMAIC approach: Measure SMED time = time to change series then Analyze = separate internal and external tasks then I = innovate = transform internal tasks into external tasks, tasks that can be parallelized with production."
A standard is :
a document that describes the best way to perform a task
a document that describes the usual way to perform a task
A standard describes the best way to perform a task at a given time.
The standard is usually written:
by the team performing the task
by an external person after analysis of the task
"The standard is written by the team that performs the task, and may be improved with the help of outsiders to promote perspective."
"In the 5S method, STANDARDISING is"
the 4th S
the 5th S
the 4th S is Standardise and the 5th S is Follow.
The Standard facilitates:
versatility within a team
training of new people
the homogenization of the tasks of a Department
the definitive setting of a task
The Standard must be questioned and improved regularly.
The standard form must contain in particular:
The name of the person who wrote the standard
Improvements to be made to the Standard
The date of update of the Standard
The sub-tasks of the Standard
The name of the person who wrote the standard is not necessary since the standard must have been written by the team in charge. Improvements to be made are not included in the standard but in the problems to be solved if necessary.
The standard sheet must above all:
"to be stored in a ""standards"" file"
be accessible near the workstation that performs the task
The standard must be accessible to those who perform the task.
Agile methods appear:
in 1986
in 1970
in 2001
in 1515
"Agile methods appeared in 1986 in an article in the Harvard Business Review, written by Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka, two Japanese executives... from the marketing world."
The article at the origin of agile methods starts like this:
"In today's fast-paced and fiercely competitive world of commercial new product development, speed and flexibility are essential"
"In today's world of sustainable development, where the climate is changing, taking into account the finitude of resources is essential"
"In today's fast-paced and fiercely competitive world of high-tech commercial product development, speed and flexibility are essential"
"In today's fast-paced and fiercely competitive world of digital product development, speed and flexibility are essential"
"At the origin of agile methods, digital or technology are not the only ones targeted. Later, the adoption of agile methods will be more important in the digital world which will infiltrate all sectors of activity."
A VICA world means :
"Volatile, Uncertain, Complex, Ambiguous"
"Vulgar, Indecisive, Complicated, Ambidextrous"
"Volatile, Uncertain, Complicated, Ambiguous"
"Voluntary, Committed, Clear, Friendly"
"The main difference between complicated and complex: we can understand a complicated thing, but not always a complex thing. Our current world is so complicated that it becomes complex!"
The agile manifesto was written:
in 2001
in 1986
in 2010
in 1515
"2001, 17 computer scientists meet and elaborate the Agile Manifesto, which can still be read on the website https://agilemanifesto.org/."
The most famous agile method is :
The SCRUM method
The SPRINT method
The SPRINT is one of the tools of the SCRUM method.
Agile methods make it possible to carry out projects whose needs are difficult to quantify from the start.
TRUE
FALSE
"In our VICA world, products are constantly evolving. Hence the emergence of agile methods."
The Product Owner or PO... or Product Manager is the person in charge of:
provide the vision and business requirements of the Department or product
to maximize the product's Added Value
help the team to move forward independently
to act as an interface between the team and the outside world
The PO should not be confused with the Scrum Master who is sometimes equated with a project manager.
The Scrum Master is the person responsible for:
provide the vision and business requirements of the Department or product
to maximize the product's Added Value
help the team to move forward independently
to act as an interface between the team and the outside world
The Scrum Master should not be confused with the Project Owner who is the product manager.
The standup is also called :
the daily mix
the sprint
The standup is the daily ritual of the agile world.
SPRINT is not :
a short iteration
an animation loop
a strategic meeting
a quick coding of a computer functionality
The sprint is a loop of animation breaking down a development process that generally lasts 1 to 2 weeks.
"A ""user story"" is :"
"a simple sentence, written in everyday language"
a functional need expressed by a client
a fictional account of how we landed a client
a task to be performed during a sprint
"User stories are simple sentences, written in everyday language, which describe a functional need expressed by a customer. They are associated with tasks to be carried out in order to meet this need expressed by the customer. They are therefore not strictly speaking tasks."
Sprint Kanban boards typically include five columns:
"""BACKLOG, TO DO, WORK IN-PROCESS, TO VALIDATE, COMPLETED"
"""SANDBOX, TO DO, WORK IN-PROCESS, TO VALIDATE, COMPLETED"
The Kanban of a sprint includes the Backlog and possibly a 6th column for the less urgent features that we put in SANDBOX (or Sandbox).
The Backlog of a sprint includes:
the most urgent user stories
the user stories of the current sprint
The Backlog lists the urgent functionalities expected by the customer.
The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:
understand why things didn't go as planned
to do the postmortem of the sprint
problem solving with the team
to see if the customer is satisfied with the new features
Customer Satisfaction is not discussed during the sprint retrospective but can lead to new user stories brought up by the PO to improve the features released at the end of a sprint.
Lean and agile methods are incompatible.
TRUE
FALSE
"Lean and agile methods are close and complementary. Our advice: first do Lean and if you are in a VICA domain, then complete it with tools from agile methods."
"In the 1st value of the agile manifesto, it is considered that what is more important are:"
The individuals
The processes
The interactions
The tools
The 1st value of the agile manifesto is: People and interactions... more than processes and tools
The 2nd value of the agile manifesto emphasizes:
An operational product
A well-documented code
The 2nd value of the agile manifesto is: Operational software more than exhaustive documentation which does not mean that there is no technical documentation but that the customer's satisfaction is at the center of the company.
The 3rd value of the agile manifesto is :
Collaboration with clients
Collaboration within the agile team
Collaboration with customers more than contractual negotiation is the 3rd value of the agile manifesto
The 4th value of the agile manifesto is :
Adapting to change
Reporting on a plan
Adapting to change more than following a plan is the 4th value of the agile manifesto.
The 1st principle of the agile manifesto is: Satisfy the customer by delivering ....
regularly high added value functionalities
quickly from low added value features
Satisfying the customer by delivering high value-added features quickly and regularly is the 1st principle of the agile manifesto.
Welcoming change requests even late in product development is :
contrary to the agile manifesto
in accordance with the agile manifesto
Welcoming change requests even late in the product development is the 2nd principle of the agile manifesto.
It is better to release major updates with a lot of new features than to release frequent updates with little new features.
TRUE
FALSE
"Delivering operational software (for example) as often as possible with cycles of a few weeks, giving priority to the shortest possible delays is the 3rd principle of the agile manifesto."
The 4th principle of the agile manifesto is: Ensure permanent cooperation....
between stakeholders and the product team
between the stakeholders and the company's management
between the production and the management of the company
between production and the company's customers
"The cooperation between the stakeholders and the product team is fundamental, the product team being then in charge of passing on to production the needs of the stakeholders and in particular those of the customer in the form of user stories."
The 5th principle of the agile manifesto is :
Recruiting motivated people
Provide an environment and support for employees
Trust the teams to achieve the objectives
Set up a profit-sharing scheme based on individual results
"In the world of agile, incentives should be implemented on the whole team rather than on an individual basis."
The agile manifesto considers that the most effective method of conveying information is :
face-to-face dialogue
clear and concise writing
"In the world of agile, face-to-face dialogue is preferred to written exchanges, but this does not prevent us from recording what is said orally."
The primary measure of progress (and success) in a business is :
An operational product
Its capacity for innovation
"In the agile manifesto, the primary measure of progress (and success) for an enterprise is an operational product."
Agile projects must move at a pace:
sustainable and constant
fast and smooth
"Even if the speed and regularity of releases is an objective of agile teams, the sustainability of these objectives is even more important. Otherwise, beware of burn-out!"
It's better to :
Technical and design excellence
Sales and marketing excellence
"Without technical and design excellence, there is no point in being at the top of your game in terms of marketing and sales!"
Aiming for simplicity in production means:
Minimize the amount of unnecessary work
Minimize product functionality
"Thinking about how to do something in order to spend as little time as possible is essential. It is better to think beforehand, than to redo it afterwards."
"The best architectures, specifications and designs emerge from the teams:"
self-organized
well controlled
"The best architectures, specifications and designs emerge from self-organized teams, this is the 11th principle of the agile manifesto."
Thinking about how to become more efficient must be done:
at regular intervals
every time a problem arises
Continuous and regular improvement is the 12th principle of the Agile Manifesto.
"For a company to be successful, it must:"
That employees communicate effectively
"That they all ""push"" in the same direction"
That all employees think alike
That each team is independent
"For a company to be successful, employees must communicate and push in the same direction, which does not mean that they all think alike. Teams should not be independent but connected and autonomous."
Performance management rituals are there to :
improve communication within a team
verify that the team's Objectives are met
do problem solving
evaluate the performance of employees
Never do problem solving during Management rituals and especially during short interval animations. Reserve this for specific meetings.
Performance loops are organized:
every time a problem arises
with fixed frequency
The fixed frequency is THE absolute principle of Management rituals also called performance loops.
AIC stands for :
Short Interval Animation
Action at Interstice Court
We also talk about performance loops and Top 5 or Top 10.
"In the agile world, AIC-type rituals are called :"
sprints
standups
scrums
of SAFe
Sprints are the weekly or bi-weekly animations. Scrum is the most known agile method and SAFe is an agile and lean method specific to large organizations.
The AIC rules are:
have the meeting every day at the same time
make the meeting every hour if the customers are delivered every hour
involve the entire team
stand and speak for less than a minute
The AIC can be performed every hour if the company's Takt Time corresponds to this rhythm.
SQCDM are benchmark indicators and stand for:
Safety Quality Cost Delay Motivation
Safety Quantity Cost Defects Motivation
Health Quality Cost Delay Motivation
Inventories Quantity Costs Defects Motivation
The SQCDM Indicators are often used in 2nd level performance loops such as AIC 2.
We will have as many animation loops:
than levels of organization chart
than the number of products
"The green loop is the field level loop, the blue is the manager level loop and the yellow is the direction level loop."
"For a good AIC, you need:"
that employees are not afraid to say they have problems
that employees are not afraid to say they are not competent
that employees are not afraid to generate conflicts among themselves
that employees are not afraid to do non-quality work
"Being trusting (and therefore reporting problems) and able to be transparent (and therefore acknowledging incompetence) must be the mindset of employees for effective AIC. This means that conflict is not a means of communication, but rather benevolence. It should also allow to chase away non-quality thanks to a quick resolution of problems following the AIC."
Visual management includes:
The way you visually manage your inventory and work in progress
The visualization of your pedestrian or vehicle pathways
Display of key indicators for a team
Displaying the problem solving tables
Visual management includes everything about the company that is displayed for all to see. We remember much better what we see!
The pilot room is a good place to be:
to performance management rituals
at strategic meetings
at the starting pots
problem-solving meetings
"The obeya is a good place for all company meetings because it contains the key information at a given moment. For farewell parties or anniversaries, choose a friendly place!"
The control room is frozen once and for all
TRUE
FALSE
Obeya is constantly evolving as problems are solved and objectives and achievements change.
The pilot room is designed by the leaders
TRUE
FALSE
"The obeya is ideally designed by the team, under the leadership of the leaders who propose achievable Objectives, co-defined with the team."
"What is Lean, first of all?"
a philosophy
a methodology
a toolbox
a corporate strategy
"Lean is first and foremost a philosophy, a state of mind that has given birth to methods and tools."
"What is the first principle of Lean, from which the following principles follow?"
Putting the customer at the center of your business
The hunt for waste
The quality
Collective intelligence
"Putting the customer's needs at the center of the company is the first principle of Lean, because everything depends on the customer. Without demand, there is no company!"
"Why does Lean advocate ""continuous process improvement""?"
Customer needs are changing
Processes are evolving
Routine leads to boredom
The processes never work
"In the Lean philosophy, following a continuous improvement approach is essential because everything evolves: customers, processes, employees, and common sense and good habits can be lost!"
What is the purpose of Tighten its flows?
Reduce the time between order and delivery
Reduce time from order to inventory
Reduce the time between inventory receipt and removal
Reduce inventory
"Tightening its flows allows you to reduce your work in progress and inventory to just what is needed to meet demand, which in turn reduces costs and minimizes delivery delays and therefore payment for orders."
The 5S method allows us to reduce the number of trips.
TRUE
FALSE
The 5S method can reduce travel and more globally reduce the time it takes for everyone to be operational.
The 5S method allows you to reduce expectations.
TRUE
FALSE
"The 5S method allows to reduce expectations by avoiding, for example, the mutualisation of tools when they are likely to be used simultaneously."
What is Kaizen?

"In this tutorial, we will explain the main principles of the interface of the [SCHOOL_NAME] challenges. Let's go for a tour!"
You have just seen how to move around the Factory and the basics of the interface. You can review each Notions as many times as you like!
Tutorial
"The objective of this notion is to make you discover the famous ""7 types of waste"" of Lean, and to identify some of them."
Did you remember the 7 types of waste? Do you have an idea of the worst waste for a company? No idea? Relaunch this notion!
The 7 types of waste
"The objective of this notion is to understand how fundamental it is to go to the field to collect the problems and suggestions of the employees, and to do this is to do a Gemba Walk."
You have seen in this notion of the Gemba Walk how useful it is to go and see what people have to say on the ground. No one has a better view of problems than those who encounter them! This is why the Gemba Walk is essential in the Lean Management philosophy.
The Gemba Walk
The objective of this notion is to understand the functioning of the Dashboard that gathers the data collected in a company.
"The Dashboard contains all the information you need to understand where the problems in your business are coming from. You have some basic information by default like cash flow or material cost and drone sales price. But for others, you need to have the corresponding Indicators enabled for the curves to be displayed!"
The Dashboard
Indicators are the key information to monitor the performance of a company. The objective of this concept is to understand how to set up indicators and especially to understand why it is necessary to choose the right ones!
Having Indicators is essential. Without Indicators you cannot identify your company's problems and set objectives for improvement. My advice: activate the right Indicators at the beginning of each challenge!
The Indicators
"Building the Spaghetti Flow is about tracing the physical path that the product takes from Raw Materials to the Finished product. It's a great tool to identify transportation waste. In this notion, you will learn how to draw your first Spaghetti Flow!"
"You have just learned how to make a Spaghetti Flow diagram and therefore how to plan the product flow in the production. You have seen that this flow was not optimal. To improve this path, we are going to proceed to a Relocation of the Workstations and observe how a good Relocation allows to eliminate the transport wastes."
The Spaghetti Diagram
"Along with the Spaghetti Flow, the VSM (Value Stream Mapping) is another essential Lean flow mapping tool. In this notion, we will learn how to build a simplified VSM."
"Knowing how to read a VSM (Value Stream Mapping) is the best way to spot problems! Knowing how to calculate the data of your VSM is another story. Do not hesitate to watch the video ""Using Lean tools at [SCHOOL_NAME]"" which explains how to read a VSM in more detail!"
The VSM (Value Stream Mapping)
The Spaghetti Diagram revealed transportation waste. Now learn how to relocate your stations to eliminate transportation waste. Let's go!
Now you know the Spaghetti diagram and the action of Relocation of the posts. Let's see if you know how to implement all this in a first challenge where you have to relocate your posts to avoid Collisions.
Relocation
"Assigning Logisticians to workstations often leads to greater productivity, reduced transportation waste and avoids collisions. Learn how here."
You have just seen that proper Assignment of logisticians prevents Collisions and reduces transportation waste. Put this into practice in a first challenge.
Assignment of logisticians
The Transported Batch Size is the number of products that Logisticians move between two stations. Setting up the right batch size allows to avoid wasteful overstocking and defects. We will understand here why!
"You have just seen that a good Batch Size allows to fluidify the production. A Batch Size that is too high generates high and therefore unnecessary Work in-process, defects and waiting times on the stations. And ultimately delays in delivery to customers. Practice on this first challenge!"
Transported Batch Size
"In this notion, we are going to talk about the total Work in-process and the maximum Work in-process per Pallet. So, too much or too little Work in-process?"
"A well-tuned work-in-process avoids ""defect"" type waste and ""overproduction"". Indirectly, low WIP reduces the time it takes to move products through the Factory. Work in-process is an essential notion to understand in order to succeed in the most difficult challenges. Feel free to watch it again!"
The Work in-process
"You will now have to manage your inventory and the associated suppliers. In this notion, discover how to place orders with them to avoid being out of stock!"
You are now ready to place your first supplier orders in the next challenge!
Supplier orders
Discover new indicators to better manage your Logistic chain and your inventory.
These new management elements will be essential for the good control of your Logistic chain. Always keep an eye on this Dashboard in the future.
Inventory values and order forecasts
The objective of this introduction is to explain why we created this Yellow Belt Course at [SCHOOL_NAME] and what it will do for you.
Let's see how to use the [SCHOOL_NAME] interface. Let's start!
Introduction
The objective of this module is to understand how fundamental it is to visit those in the field to collect their problems and suggestions! And to do this is to do a Gemba Walk.
This Gemba Walk module shows the importance of talking to people on the ground. No one has a better view of problems than those who encounter them! This is why the Gemba Walk is essential in the Lean Management philosophy.
The Gemba Walk
"Building the Spaghetti Flow is about tracing the physical path that the product takes from Raw Materials to Finished goods. It's a great tool for identifying transportation waste. In this module, you will learn how to draw your first Spaghetti diagram!"
"You have just learned how to make a Spaghetti diagram, the product flow plan in production. The current flow is not optimal. To improve it, we will now proceed to a Relocation of the Workstations and eliminate the transport wastes."
The Spaghetti Diagram
The Spaghetti Diagram revealed transportation waste. Now learn how to relocate your stations to eliminate transportation waste. Let's go!
Now you know how to draw a Spaghetti diagram and relocate your workstations. Let's see if you know how to put it all into practice in a first challenge!
Relocation
"Help, we have plenty of Collisions! We are counting on you to relocate workstations to prevent this."
"Relocation costs money and requires time for operators to reorganize. And in the meantime, we don't produce! What if you thought about the right layout from the start so that you don't change it too often? Let's start the challenge again!"
"You still have Collisions: your layout is not up to scratch! How about trying a different layout, making sure that the Logisticians' travel flows do not cross each other? Let's start the challenge again?"
Relocation of a production line (difficulty 1)
You are making progress! Accidents have been reduced by relocating workstations; Logisticians are no longer likely to cross paths. But you haven't produced enough drones to meet production objectives. Maybe you can still improve the layout and reduce the distance between the stations?
"By relocating workstations the right way, Logisticians no longer cross paths and transportation waste has also been significantly reduced."
"Through a mini-game, we will teach you the basics of the 5S method."
Mini-game on the 5S method
"The Workstations are installed in an odd way, we count on you to put some order in it."
"Relocation costs money and requires time for operators to reorganize. And during this time, we don't produce! What if we thought about the right location from the start so that we don't change it too often? Let's start the challenge again!"
"You still have Collisions, so your layout is not up to par! How about trying a different layout and making sure that the Logisticians' travel flows do not cross each other? Let's start the challenge again?"
Relocation of a production line (difficulty 1)
"You are making progress! You have reduced the number of Collisions. However, you didn't produce enough drones to meet your production Objectives. Are you starting over?"
you have reduced the risk of accidents by relocating workstations; Logisticians are no longer likely to cross paths. you have also significantly reduced transportation waste by decreasing the distances traveled in the entire process.
"Find the right Transported batch Size to meet the Delays expected by the customers, i.e. more than 11 drones per minute (Be careful, you can't stock more than 5 drones per Pallet)."
"you lost because you were short of cash flow! Changes take time to take effect, so why don't you think about your actions a little more in advance?"
You haven't been able to achieve the Objectives! Changes take time to take effect. What if you thought a little more upfront about your actions?
Manage Transported Batch Size
"You have succeeded in meeting the Customer Demand, congratulations! But you didn't reach the other Objectives. What if you started over?"
"Here is my favorite solution: in order to meet the Customer order, we need to increase the Transported batch and Logistic sizes to 4! With this increase, Operators wait less because they receive more product with each Logistician pass. Note that a Batch Size of 5 would have allowed to reach the Objectives but it would have generated overproduction. And let's never forget: overproduction is the ultimate waste because it leads to almost all the others!"
You can only change the maximum work in-process per Pallet. Improve lead time while still meeting customer demand.
"You lost because you were short of cash flow! Changes take time to take effect, so how about thinking a little further ahead about your actions?"
"You have not been able to reach our Objectives. Is your work-in-process too high? This could lead to a too long Lead time, and therefore prevent you from reaching your production Objectives. Why don't you (re)watch the video on Lead time and the notion of Work in-process? And let's start the challenge again afterwards!"
Mastering a work in-process (difficulty 1)
You have reached the production objectives! Try again to reach the other Objectives.
"Personally, here is my favorite solution: in order to improve the product lead time and thus reach the production objectives, I reduce the work in-process! This allows me to reduce the waiting time at each station. And I don't set it too low because, otherwise, it generates product waiting on the stations. The right work-in-process!"
"You're not getting the production the customer expects, so find a way to do it without creating any collisions."
"In addition to impacting the team's Well-being and health, Accidents are costly! Maybe we should change the assignments by putting only one Logistician per shift? Let's try?"
"Your assignment doesn't seem to be the right one, some Logisticians are crossing each other too often and this causes accidents. What if you change the assignments by putting only one Logistician per shift? Shall we try?"
Managing logistics (difficulty 1)
"You are making progress! You have no more Collisions, but you haven't been able to meet your Production Objectives. What if you tried to hire?"
"you have won this challenge! In my opinion, the best solution is to reassign the Logisticians, which allows you to meet your production and safety objectives."
Here is a first challenge with a small production line (3 workstations). Your objective is to produce at least 15 products per minute without any collisions or defects.
You lost out because you were short on cash flow! Changes take time to have an effect. It doesn't show up immediately on our Indicators! What if you thought a little more upfront about your actions?
You have not been able to meet production Objectives. What if you hired Logisticians and tried to reduce transportation times? Try this challenge again!
Controlling a 3-station production line
"It's not so bad...you've increased Productivity. However, you didn't achieve the Secondary goals... Two ideas: remove Crossroads in the Logisticians' Course? Reduce the max WIP per Pallet so that products don't spoil, what do you think?"
"Here's my favorite strategy to solve this challenge: By hiring one or two Logisticians, I increase Productivity. Their proper assignment and Relocation of jobs prevents Collisions. Finally, I adjust the Work in-process to eliminate defects and limit transportation waste by increasing the Batch Size."
"Welcome to the ""Sandbox"": here you have access to all the features seen so far, with no time or money limit, so feel free to test different configurations of your production line!"
Yellow Belt Sandbox
"In the previous level, you performed a diagnostic of this Factory. Use this diagnosis to reach the challenge's objectives! Eliminate the Collisions and then manufacture the number of drones needed to deliver the customers on time, all while minimizing the Work in-process. Yes, it's possible!"
You lost out because you were short on cash flow! Changes take time to have an effect. It doesn't show up immediately on our Indicators! What if you thought a little more upfront about your actions?
"Remember that the safety of our employees is the priority. A reallocation and implementation without Crossroads ""nodes"" would be a good solution to achieve this objective. Once that is taken care of, we will focus on the Work in-process and Productivity Objectives OK?"
Managing a 5-shift production line
Perhaps you could meet your production objectives by reducing travel and waiting waste and reducing the maximum amount of work-in-process per pallet?
"Here's my favorite solution: Relocate the Workstations, reassign the Logisticians and adjust the maximum Work in-process per Pallet, thus meeting the Objectives! Finally, by changing Batch Size, I minimize Logistician travel and wait time at production stations."
"The Factory has acquired a packaging machine, so the production line is now composed of 6 stations. Will you be able to meet this challenge with the objective of achieving a very low lead time?"
You lost out because you were short on cash flow! Changes take time to have an effect. It doesn't show up immediately on our Indicators! What if you thought a little more upfront about your actions?
"By setting the WIP lower, do you think you could meet the Lead time goal? Once that is settled we will focus on Productivity and ""0 defects""!"
Controlling a 6-shift production line
"Perhaps we need to look at eliminating transportation waste... Perhaps through the relocation of our Logisticians, by relocating jobs and changing Batch Size? Are you trying?"
"My preferred solution to achieve the objectives of this challenge: low work in-process, good Relocation of logisticians and Assignment of logisticians adapted to the work rates."
"Now that you know how to relocate your stations and reassign your Logisticians, use these two skills to solve safety issues while manufacturing the number of drones needed to meet customer demand."
"In addition to impacting team Well-being, Accidents are costly. You had to make unnecessary changes. Repeat the challenge by diagnosing the problems before you act!"
"Your assignment doesn't seem to be right, some Logisticians are crossing each other too often and causing Collisions. Try to relocate the positions and Assignment of logisticians to avoid logisticians crossing each other, ok? let's start the challenge again!"
Relocation of a line and management of logistics
"The most important thing is that you have managed to avoid collisions. Unfortunately, you didn't reach your production objectives. What if you reduced the lead time even further by reducing the distance between stations?"
"Well done, you've done it! My favorite solution: a ""node-free"" layout and a good Assignment of logisticians. It eliminates unnecessary travel, waiting at the stations and above all, goodbye to accidents!"
"Try to meet Customer Demand while keeping production flowing. You can only change Work in-process and Batch Size, good luck!"
You lost out because you were short on cash flow! Changes take time to have an effect. It doesn't show up immediately on our Indicators! What if you thought a little more upfront about your actions?
"Remember: the higher the maximum work in-process per pallet, the higher the total work in-process, the longer the lead time OK?"
Manage and control Batch Size and Work in-process
Maybe because Operators have too low an Occupancy rate? What if the Logisticians brought them more products at once?
"Here's my preferred solution: Lowering the work in-process prevents overstocking, but I leave it high enough to give the Operators something to work with. Then I lower the Batch Size a bit to meet production Objectives."
Can you find it and solve the problem to achieve the desired Throughput?
"You lost out because you were short on cash flow! How about focusing on debottlenecking that pesky Bottleneck workstation first? And then you know, changes take time to take effect. It doesn't show up immediately on our Indicators! What if you thought a little more upfront about your actions?"
"What if you focused on debottlenecking the damn Bottleneck workstation first? What if a reallocation of Logisticians and a layout without Crossroads ""nodes"" were the way to achieve the Objectives?"
Identify and process a Bottleneck workstation
"You have managed to avoid collisions by eliminating crossings in the flows. Unfortunately, you failed to meet your production and quality Objectives. And on your next try, you focus on debottlenecking that damn Bottleneck workstation?"
"Here is my strategy: thanks to the VSM I identify the Bottleneck workstation and I debottleneck it. Then I improve the layout, reassign the logisticians and that's it!"
"We just expanded the Factory, it's great we have a lot more space. Unfortunately we don't have any more money... We count on you to straighten the bar (don't hesitate to use the new space, we paid a lot for it...)."
Too bad you lost due to lack of cash flow... Let's try another strategy OK?
Changes take time to have an effect. It doesn't show up immediately on our Indicators! What if you thought about your actions a little earlier?
Why did we expand the Factory? We're running out of cash!
"You have succeeded in reaching the ""0 Collision"" objective! Unfortunately, you have not achieved the Secondary goals. Here's a hint: once Productivity has improved, and our Cash flow goes back up, we can afford to relocate jobs."
"For me, the right solution to this challenge is, first of all, to reduce transport waste by increasing Batch Size. To reduce Collisions, I assign Logisticians to different jobs. Finally, hiring an additional Logistician allows us to increase Productivity. Finally, with cash flow back on track, I can invest in a suitable relocation to meet production objectives."
The purpose of this introduction is to explain why we created [SCHOOL_NAME] and what it will do for you.
We will now see together how to use the interface of the [SCHOOL_NAME]. Let's start!
Introduction
"Through a mini-game, we will teach you the basics of the 5S method."
"Remember, a 5S Workshop consists of: 1st S: Remove: sort out the unnecessary 2nd S: Locate: tidy up what is useful 3rd S: Sparkle: clean up the work area 4th S: Standardize: keep in order 5th S: Monitor: check that the previous 4 S are respected on a daily basis."
Mini-game on the 5S method
"In this notion, you will discover a new rule of the game: the customer will now place orders every minute. Let's discover this ordering principle. The customer is at the center of the company and drives all the flows! This is one of the main principles of Lean."
You have just learned how Finished goods gauges work and how to use them in simulation. Always keep an eye on this indicator in order to best satisfy Customer Demand.
The Customer order
Customers are now placing orders... But how to follow these orders? Let's see the Indicators to be put in place and discover a very useful tool: the ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning).
You have just seen which Indicators to put in place to monitor Customer orders through the ERP tool. It will allow you to monitor and measure the overall performance of your company.
ERP (customer order information)
"It's nice to be able to change series on the fly, but it's very constraining to have to keep an eye on the workstation that's doing the changeover. Let's see how to set up a system that allows you to plan a series changeover."
"You have just discovered how to plan and automate changeover times. This allows you to produce as lean as possible and to obtain optimum performance. However, if your Customer orders backlog and mix evolves, it will be necessary to review your production batch sizes to adapt to these new orders."
Planning the Changeover series
"FIFO (First In, First Out) is a method of organizing inventory and work-in-process. It allows to respect the order of picking up products as defined by the changeover."
"You have just seen the FIFO (First In, First Out), a method of organizing inventory and work-in-process. You now know that it allows you to keep a defined order by changing series."
"FIFO (First In, First Out)"
"In this challenge, you must produce drones of 3 different colors."
Managing a 3-reference production
"Our Factory can now manufacture drones in different colors, which is great news for our customers... However, it makes the production flow quite complex, so let's see how we can organize ourselves!"
In this Notions you have discovered the principle of Changeover. You have also seen how the changeover time is an NVA and that it requires a new inventory control.
The Mix product
The creation of Logistics routes or MADC (component delivery) will solve this problem.
You have just seen how the improvement of Logistics routes (or MADC = component delivery) allows to optimize the Logisticians' movements for more safety and efficiency.
Logistics routes or MADC
Nothing is going well anymore! Customers are not delivered on time. We have to find a solution to satisfy our customers!
This Factory is really badly organized...
"Panic on board! We put green drones in the customer catalog, while our production organization is not adapted. We count on you to set up the right changeover. Good luck!"
Controlling a production line (difficulty 1)
The Logisticians are not able to supply the posts at a sufficient rate... We must find a solution to accelerate their pace... while being careful not to exhaust them of course!
Set up a logistics route
FIFO inventory control is essential on a manufacturing line with one or more changeovers. Beware! Setting up a FIFO takes time. It is better to do it when you are ahead of the orders.
Adapt to Customer Demand
"Let's see if you understand how the changeover works. For the moment there are only 2 different drones, but be careful, it's not that easy."
To change series with 2 colors
"This Factory is not working properly, the cash flow is melting like snow in the sun... We have to find a solution and fast!"
Controlling a production line (difficulty 2)
"You are now going to discover a factory in operation! Observe it carefully to collect the information necessary to carry out your 1st Lean diagnosis! WARNING! Before answering the questions, let the factory run for at least 1 minute to obtain the indicators in stabilized production!"
Factory : First diagnosis
"Here is a new Factory to observe! Many things were wrong in the previous Factory, but this one is organized differently. Observe the same elements as in your first diagnosis and perform your 2nd Lean diagnosis!"
Factory : Second diagnosis
It is difficult to implement improvements in the middle of Manufacturing an order... Beware of fatal errors... You will have to be rigorous and patient!
Controlling a production line (difficulty 3)
Find and hunt the NVA among the tasks of the two departments present in this level.
"Cash flow is dry, without money it is difficult to pay employees for their work!"
Time's up... Try to act faster next time!

Cash flow is dry. Do it again!
Time's up... Try to act faster next time!
Managing a Yamazumi with 3 Departments
Well done! You have completed the Main goal!
You have completed all the Objectives!
This time you can't modify the Yamazumi but it doesn't matter because no NVA is present among the tasks of the different departments. Modify the level of in-process and relocate the departments to reduce the lead time!
"Cash flow is dry, without money it is difficult to pay employees for their work!"
Time's up... Try to act faster next time!
Re-location of Departments
Well done! You have completed the Main goal!
You have completed all the Objectives!
Hunt the NVA among the tasks of the 3 departments of this level. Relocate to reduce the Lead time!
"Cash flow is dry, without money it is difficult to pay employees for their work!"
Time's up... Try to act faster next time!
VA and NVA in Yamazumi
Well done! You have completed the Main goal!
You have completed all the Objectives!
"Use all the tools at your disposal to improve your process performance, reach Takt Time and reduce Lead time!"
"Cash flow is dry, without money it is difficult to pay employees for their work!"
Time's up... Try to act faster next time!
Let's review the basics of the office!
Well done! You have completed the Main goal!
"There are important improvements to be made in this Factory! It will be necessary to launch them at the right time, when the cash flow allows it..."
Controlling a production line (difficulty 4)
"We did relocate the workstations, but now the Logisticians have accidents all the time. They only have a small corridor to walk down! How can we fix this?"
The Collision corridor
"The following 3 modules are a ""Problem solving method"". It includes the following steps: 1) contextualize the problem 2) find the potential causes 3) find the root cause In this first mini-game, you will discover the 4W1H methods which consists in contextualizing the problem."
"In this mini-game, you have discovered the 4W1H methods, this method allows you to contextualize a problem."
Problem Solving: 4W1H methods
"Logisticians are complaining about the unsafe placement of posts, and we're counting on you to put some order into it."
"Relocation costs money and time to reorganize. And in the meantime, you don't produce! What if you thought about the right location from the start so that you don't change it too often? Let's start the challenge again!"
"You still have Collisions, so your layout is not up to par! How about trying a different layout and making sure that the Logisticians' travel flows do not cross each other? Let's start the challenge again?"
Relocation of a production line (difficulty 2)
You are making progress! Accidents have been reduced by relocating workstations; Logisticians are no longer likely to cross paths. But you haven't produced enough drones to meet production objectives. Maybe you can still improve the layout and reduce the distance between the stations?
"By relocating workstations the right way, Logisticians no longer cross paths and transportation waste has also been significantly reduced."
We have no Collision but we produce very few products... Try to increase the production rate without creating any Collision.
"In addition to impacting the team's Well-being and health, Accidents are costly! Maybe you should change the assignments by putting only one Logistician per shift? let's try?"
"Your assignment doesn't seem to be the right one, some Logisticians are crossing each other too often and this causes accidents. What if you change the assignments by putting only one Logistician per shift? Shall we try?"
Managing logistics (difficulty 2)
You are getting better! The production objective is reached but you still have Collisions. What if you tried to assign your Logisticians in a different way?
Hooray! Logisticians were reassigned to meet production and safety objectives.
We are not reaching the number of drones per minute necessary to satisfy Customer Demand. But our Logisticians are on the ball! What can we do?
"you lost because you were short of cash flow! Changes take time to take effect, so why don't you think about your actions a little more in advance?"
You haven't been able to achieve the Objectives! Changes take time to take effect. What if you thought a little more upfront about your actions?
Manage Transported Batch Size and Logistic
"You have succeeded in meeting the Customer Demand, congratulations! But you didn't reach the other Objectives. What if you started over?"
"Congratulations, you have won this challenge! In order to respond to the Customer order, we had to increase the Batch Size! Thanks to this increase, Operators are waiting less because they receive more products at each Logistician passage. Note that a Batch Size that was too large could have generated defects due to product stacking. We have to find the right balance!"
"We wanted to set up a continuous two-piece-by-two-piece flow, i.e. a constant flow of maximum two products per shift. Unfortunately this is not suitable for the current manufacturing line, so keep the lead time reasonable but make sure you meet the customer demand."
"You lost because you were short of cash flow! Changes take time to take effect, so how about thinking a little further ahead about your actions?"
"You have not been able to reach our Objectives. Is your work-in-process too high? This could lead to a too long Lead time, and therefore prevent you from reaching your production Objectives. Why don't you (re)watch the video on Lead time and the notion of Work in-process? And let's start the challenge again afterwards!"
Mastering a work in-process (difficulty 2)
"Great, you've reached the production objectives! Try again to reach the other Objectives."
"Here is my solution: in order to reach the production objectives, I increase the Work in-process to 4. This allows me to decrease the waiting time at each station, to maintain a Lead time under 1'30"" and the total in-process under 40 and to meet the objective of number of drones manufactured per minute."
The purpose of this introduction is to explain why we created [SCHOOL_NAME] and what it will do for you.
We will now see how to use the [SCHOOL_NAME] interface. Let's start!

Problem Solving: The Ichikawa Diagram
"In this third mini-game on Problem solving, you will discover the 5 Whys method. Once the context is established (thanks to the 4W1H methods) and the potential causes are found (thanks to the Ishikawa Diagram), the 5 Whys method allows to find the root cause of a problem."
"In this mini-game, you discovered the 5 Whys method. This method allows you to find the root cause of a problem."
Problem Solving: The 5 Whys
"In this level, you will perform a diagnosis (Measure and Analyze) of a Factory. Observe it carefully to collect the necessary information. WARNING! Before answering the questions, let the Factory run for at least 1 minute to obtain the Indicators in stabilized production!"
Diagnosis : Controlling a 5-shift production line
The Red/Green analysis consists of the observation of an Operator at his Workstation in order to improve his performance by reducing waste as much as possible. The analysis is composed of 4 steps: 1. observation and classification of the tasks 2. analysis of the share of Added Value (VA) and Non-Value Added (NVA) 3. implementation of improvements 4. new analysis
You just learned how to do a Red/Green analysis!
Mini-game on Red/Green analysis
"Our order book is changing, as are the types of drones being manufactured. Find out what impact this has on the production line and how best to manage your changeovers."
You now know how to change series and control your production line according to customer demand and the product mix he wants.
The product mix: advanced operation
"Discover the main features of our simulation. How to interact with the characters, and how to measure and improve your performance. Let's get started!"
"You have just discovered the main features of our simulation. How to interact with the characters, optimize your Batch Size and WIP, use the Production Indicators and the Dashboard."
Recap of the operation of the [SCHOOL_NAME]
This is the first challenge in which you will have to order your own components.
"Too bad, you've used up all the cash flow. Be careful not to order more components than you need to satisfy your customers."
You haven't found any resources. I'm sure you didn't give it your all!
My first supplier orders
"Well done! You have successfully met the customer's demands. Unfortunately, you did not reach the WIP and inventory value objectives."
Good for you! You have succeeded in keeping your WIP and inventory below your Objectives. Maybe you can do even better?
Customer orders are a little more variable. Maybe we should have set up a safety stock... For this time you will have to manage the unexpected yourself.
"Too bad, you've used up all the cash flow. Be careful not to order more components than you need to satisfy your customers."
"Unfortunately, you have not met the customer's demands. Retry the challenge and be careful with future orders."
Safety stock? What is it for?
"Well done! You have successfully met the customer's demands. Unfortunately, you did not reach the WIP and inventory value objectives."
Good for you! You have succeeded in keeping your WIP and inventory below your Objectives. Maybe you can do even better?
"I heard the last challenge was complicated. I added a Safety stock on your components, so you'll have less problems with variable orders."
"Too bad, you've used up all the cash flow. Be careful not to order more components than you need to satisfy your customers."
"Unfortunately, you have not met the customer's demands. Retry the challenge and be careful with future orders."
We finally have a safety stock
"Well done! You have successfully met the customer's demands. Unfortunately, you did not reach the WIP and inventory value objectives."

Introduction to the Supply Chain Course
"In this level, you are going to carry out the diagnosis (Measure and Analyze) of the process of the next challenge: ""Drive a 3-station production line"". Observe carefully to collect the necessary information. ATTENTION! Before answering the questions, let the Factory run for at least 1 minute to get the Indicators in stabilized production!"
Diagnosis: Controlling a 3-station production line
"In this level, you will perform the diagnosis (Measure and Analyze) of the process of your next challenge: ""Identify and treat a Bottleneck workstation"". Observe carefully to collect the necessary information. WARNING! Before answering the questions, let the Factory run for at least 1 minute to get the Indicators in stabilized production!"
Diagnosis: Identify and treat a Bottleneck workstation
"In this level, you will perform the diagnosis (Measure and Analyze) of the process of your next challenge: ""Drive a 6-station production line"". Observe carefully to collect the necessary information. WARNING! Before answering the questions, let the Factory run for at least 1 minute to get the Indicators in stabilized production!"
Diagnosis : Controlling a 6-shift production line
"The next two levels will allow you to review much of what you saw in the Yellow Belt Course. You will first perform the diagnostic (Measure and Analyze) for the next challenge: ""Why did we expand the Factory? We're running out of cash flow"". Observe carefully to gather the necessary information. WARNING! Before answering the questions, let the Factory run for at least 1 minute and 30 seconds to obtain the indicators in stabilized production!"
Diagnosis: Why did we expand the Factory? We are short of cash flow!
It's hard to keep up with a customer orders backlog that is always changing! The Safety stock function is there for that. In this notion you will discover how it works and its impact on customer orders.
Now you know how safety stock works and why it's useful. You will need them in the next challenges!
Safety stocks

"Remember the first level where you had to order your components? It's the same, but with lower WIP and inventory value objectives. Fortunately, you can implement DDMRP!"
"Too bad, you've used up all the cash flow. Be careful not to order more components than you need to satisfy your customers."
"Unfortunately, you have not met the customer's demands. Retry the challenge and be careful with future orders."
"DDMRP, the planning method par excellence"
"Well done! You have successfully met the customer's demands. Unfortunately, you did not reach the WIP and inventory value objectives."
Well done! You've managed to keep your WIP and inventory below your Objectives. Maybe you can do even better?
Let's see if DDMPR is functional when customers place highly variable orders.
"Too bad, you've used up all the cash flow. Be careful not to order more components than you need to satisfy your customers."
"Unfortunately, you have not met the customer's demands. Retry the challenge and be careful with future orders."
DDMRP and very indecisive customers
"Well done! You have successfully met the customer's demands. Unfortunately, you did not reach the WIP and inventory value objectives."
Good for you! You have succeeded in keeping your WIP and inventory below your Objectives. Maybe you can do even better?
This is the final challenge of DDMRP. The production line contains two stations with a Changeover and the customer orders are variable. Good luck!
"Too bad, you've used up all the cash flow. Be careful not to order more components than you need to satisfy your customers."
"Unfortunately, you have not met the customer's demands. Retry the challenge and be careful with future orders."

Elapsed time
Welcome to this 5S review mini-game.
"Just like in the previous 5S mini-game, we start with a messy station! Find as many resources as possible in 2 minutes. Click on Start to begin!"
Click on the objects that have disappeared.
Excellent! Only [TIME] seconds to locate all the missing items!
"You found [RESSOURCES] in 2 minutes! Not bad! With the 5S method, you should be able to do much better."
"You haven't found anything in 2 minutes. With the 5S method, you should find everything you need!"
Remove litter that clutters your workspace.
"Click on an object to be stored, then hold down the mouse/trackpad click and drag the resource to the category you think is most appropriate."
Click on the stains to remove them and make your workspace cleaner. Everything should sparkle!
Place each item in its designated slot.
"Now that you have applied the first 4 S's, find as many objects as possible again in 2 min. Click on Start to begin!"
"You have found [RESSOURCES] resources, that's as much as the first time. You can certainly do better by applying the 5S method correctly!"
"[RESSOURCES] resources? It's less than the first time. You can do the minigame again because in my opinion, with the 5S, you should be able to do much better."
"You have found [RESSOURCES] objects! That's [BONUS] more objects than the first time, which represents a gain of [PERCENT]%! Congratulations!"
"Unfortunately, you didn't find any items in both searches, so you probably had better things to do! Try this mini-game again!"
You have moved as much as the first time. There is still room for improvement in terms of organization.
"In addition, you have made [MOVES] fewer trips per item. That means less time wasted, less fatigue and less risk of Collision!"
"On the other hand, you have made about [MOVES] more trips per object. There is still room for improvement in terms of organization."
Welcome to this 5S mini-game.
"The 5S is one of the key methods of Lean. Basically: ""A place for everything, everything in its place!"""
Here is the 1st resource to find. Look for it on the Workstation and click on it when you find it.
Well done! But in real life it's not always that easy... Some resources may have been misplaced or simply stored elsewhere.
You may have noticed that this resource is not on the Workstation. You'll have to find it elsewhere in the Factory!
"To move around the Factory, use the arrows that appear on the sides of the screen. If you look hard enough you should be able to find the resource you need!"
Here it is! You've figured out that resources aren't always at your fingertips so don't hesitate to wander around if you can't find what you're looking for.
"Oh yes, I forgot to tell you! You're not the only one who needs these resources and someone just borrowed this one."
"When a resource is borrowed, you have to wait a certain amount of time before it is available again. The remaining time is displayed here. Please wait a little..."
Great! The colleague brought back the resource but sometimes some colleagues make a mistake and put it somewhere else or simply forget to bring back the resource...
"In fact, it is very likely that some of the resources you need are being used by your colleague on the next table."
"If you think so, feel free to check it out by clicking on this arrow! But don't forget that he may also have put the resources elsewhere..."
"The 5S come from the Japanese words SEIRI, SEITON, SEISO, SEIKETSU, SHITSUKE and refer to successive steps of organization of a work space."
"For this time you are lucky the resource has been brought back to you! Come on, let's go! I let you manage now. Keep your eyes open and enjoy the search!"
Hey not bad! You found [XX] resources!
"Only one resource found? That's not bad, but you can do better."
"[RESSOURCES] resources! That's right, you are the king/queen of your work environment..."
[RESSOURCES] resources! It's not bad... But I'm sure we can do better!
You haven't found any resources. I'm sure you didn't give it your all!
"You must have realized that you are wasting a lot of time going back and forth and that there is a ""little"" storage problem!"
"That's where the 5S method comes to the rescue! To begin with, the 1st S: Delete (Seiri) consists of throwing away or recycling everything that is useless."
"You will remove all the garbage that clutters your workspace. And no stress, there's no more time limit!"
"Great, now that you've removed everything that was in the way, we can see a little more clearly!"
"The 2nd S consists in Situating (Seiton) i.e. tidying up. In order to organize in a practical way, we will separate our resources into 3 categories according to their frequency of use."
"These categories are: Often: this is the case of the tools of the station which are used permanently. From time to time: this is the case of the basic materials. We have a stock of them on the workstation and we go looking for them when we run out. Rarely: this is the case of maintenance products, spare equipment etc. They are used exceptionally."
"Click on a resource to be sorted, hold down the mouse click and drag the resource to the category you think is most appropriate."
"Well done! You know the first two S's: delete and locate. Let's see the 3rd S: make Scintillate (Seiso), in other words, the cleaning of our workspace"
"Each ""S"" corresponds to a step: 1. Delete (Seiri) : sort out the useless 2. Situate (Seiton) : put away what is useful 3. Sparkle (Seiso) : clean the work space 4. Standardize (Seiketsu) : keep in order 5. Follow (Shitsuke) : check that the 4 S's are respected on a daily basis."
"Come on, make this post sparkle! Click on all the spots to make them disappear!"
"It shines! Come on Mr./Ms. Clean, let's move on to setting up a simple, functional and understandable organization of your workspace for everyone."
This is where the 4th S: Standardize (Seiketsu) comes into play. It ensures that our new organization is kept in order. It is about creating a model to refer to in order to always arrange the resources in the same way.
Standardizing storage is very important! For example to train newcomers and to follow the level of an inventory. Here we will use marking!
"That's it! With this simple standardization you will be able to put the resources in order in no time! You can also label the name of the resources, use visuals or a color code. The important thing is to find your way!"
Let's see if my tagging system is clear: drop each resource in the place where it belongs. Let's go!
"Great! It's nothing like it was before, is it?"
By implementing the first 4 S's we understand how sorting by frequency of use and proper storage of resources saves us time. And it's clean!
Let's test our new workspace in production conditions to verify the efficiency of the first 4 S's!
Do you remember how we do it I hope? It's the same! Except I slipped a note to the shop manager so that everyone had their own personal equipment!
We will implement this method on a workspace and it will all be clearer!
So no more risk of having your resources stolen and being left waiting. A small investment that can make a difference. Another Lean secret to keep in mind!
Attention I have put the timer back on! Click OK when you are ready to start!
"[XX] resources! Congratulations, this is much better than the first time! You managed to find [XX] more resources, that's a gain of [XX%]%, it's huge!"
"Come on, put some of your own into it: zero objects the first time, zero the second time..."
"Hey not bad, you found [RESSOURCES] resources. you managed to find [BONUS] more resources, a gain of about [PERCENT]%, that's great!"
"[RESSOURCES] resources, this is exceptional. Compared to the first try, you found [BONUS] more items, which is a gain of about [PERCENT]. The 5S has helped you a lot..."
"[RESSOURCES] resources, this is exceptional. Remember your first try: you found 0 resources, so you made an infinite gain in Productivity WAOW!"
"[RESSOURCES] resources? It's less than the first time. Admit it, you did it on purpose to see if we had planned it, right?"
"In addition, you have made [XX%] fewer trips, which means less time wasted, less fatigue and less risk of Collisions. All positive things!"
You came as much as the first time. There is still room for improvement in terms of organization.
"On the other hand, you have made about [MOVES] more trips per object. I also prefer to walk around than to work, that's just between us..."
"In addition, you have made approximately [MOVES] fewer trips per object, which means less time wasted, less fatigue and less risk of collision. All positive things!"
"It is difficult to compare your movements between the two searches, in one of them you found nothing..."
You now know almost everything there is to know about the 5S since the 5th and last S: Follow (Shitsuke) is neither more nor less than the verification of the good application of the previous 4S in the long run.
"It is therefore a continuous improvement process. It is very easy to fall back into disorder, which is why it is necessary to regularly ensure that the first 4 S's are well applied."
"With our new organization and a little bit of rigor it's a breeze, you'll see!"
Here is a list of all our available resources. I will remove some of them and you will have to identify which ones are missing.
Take a good look around and click on the ones you think are missing. Ready to get started?
Excellent! Only [XXs] to locate all the missing resources! I should have removed more!
"It took you [TIME] seconds to locate all the missing resources. There is still work to be done on the organization of your Workstation, you can do it!"
Excellent! Only [TIME] seconds to locate all the missing resources! I should have removed more!
"Here is a drone assembly workstation before application of the 5S. As you can see, it is not very orderly..."
"In any case, you have understood the double interest of standardization. Maintaining a good organization requires daily vigilance, but once you have simplified and standardized, it is easy!"
"By regularly checking the correct application of the 5S on his workstation and by rigorously following each step, everyone will naturally integrate these principles and gain in efficiency."
Now you know everything there is to know about the 5S method! Feel free to play this mini-game again to learn more about the method!
"You will have to perform several assembly steps. To do this you will need different resources: tools, materials, information etc. Your goal is to find a maximum of resources in a given time."
Here you can see how much time you have left to finish the exercise.
And the resources to be found are displayed in this area.
"It's simple, isn't it? So let's get started! Take a deep breath, concentrate and click on Start to start the timer!"

Recap of the challenge objectives
"If you have made changes recently, these Indicators may not reflect the true value of your production data. In fact, your changes may take time to impact the entire production chain."
Recent changes:
"The VSM feeds off the Indicators data, so if you don't have the necessary Indicators in place, they won't show up on your VSM."
Flow tension ratio
"Percentage of time the Operator is working on the product. The lower the percentage, the more time the Operator is waiting."
"The time between the start of production of one product on a workstation and the start of production of the next. In other words, the time between two products."
The flow tension ratio indicates the share of added value provided throughout the process.
This sign represents a FIFO (First In First Out) inventory management. This means that the first product entered in the stock will be the first to be removed.
Number of products entering the station. Ideal quantity = green versus quantity too high = red.
"This sign represents a Pull Flow inventory management, ie with the Kanban method. The supplier item will only produce if the customer item consumes a product."
"The time it takes for a product to traverse the entire manufacturing line, from Raw Materials inventory to Finished goods inventory. A long lead time indicates a production problem, often due to too much work in-process, too long a distance between stations and/or a non-optimized employee occupation."
Number of products in output on the station. Ideal quantity = green versus quantity too high = red.

Welcome to your first Lean diagnosis.
"Observe, record measurements and analyze what happens in this Factory by answering 10 questions."
We gathered everyone in the meeting room to get the collective intelligence going. Click on one of the contributors to start the discussion.
On the left is the Indicators selection menu. Each category contains several indicators.
"In the central part of the Dashboard, you will find the curves of the Indicators."
"Once you have taken a good look at the Factory, click on this question to answer it."
"As you saw in the Gemba Walk concept, start by interviewing everyone to get more information about the production line. Good luck!"

Hello ! I was waiting for you to make the diagnosis of this Factory! We start with a Gemba Walk to discover the problems of each one?
Choose objectives based on the problems that have been reported or that you have observed!
History
Beginning of the notion:
Objectives
"My Workstation is not very well organized, I waste time looking for my tools."
Logisticians move around a lot... Isn't there a way to optimize their travel?
Cutting sheet metal is my thing. I've got the hang of it!
These new boxes are great. Much more practical than the ones we had before.
We've been using eco-friendly paint since I asked for it. I'm glad the company is open to eco-friendly proposals.
"The day we have to make drones of different shapes, I'll have to buy a new stamping machine!"
Staying in front of the computer all day is tiring. It's a good thing we take little breaks away from the screen.
"I'm on my 17th coffee, I have to calm down, my knees are wiggling."
"I have a bit of a long cycle time... this is just between us, but that's because I spend my day watching kitty videos."
"We just bought wheelchairs, it is much more pleasant to work... Pssstttt see you at 7pm when the boss will be gone for the third edition of the wheelchair race in the open space..."
"Did you know that the circumference of the earth is 40,075 km? Hum... I know, it's no use to you..."
The 5S mini-game is very complicated for a chicken. Related to the lack of opposable thumbs. And hands.
"Since the launch of the game, the turnovers at the pizza shop next door have doubled."
"To contain our digital carbon footprint, we avoid sending GIFs in our emails. Otherwise, I would dance in your mailbox."
"Recently, Microsoft begged its users to stop using Internet Explorer. You can check it out on Google."
"My little bird has taken its flight, my little bird has taken its flight... Took his, to the flock, took his, to the flock, took his flock..."
Our developers have already fixed 785 bugs. And there are still more.
"According to a very serious online test, our Game Designer is a Papuan. Whatever that means."
"It seems that real chickens don't talk. So, I wonder what you expected when you clicked on me?"
"It's been a while since you've spoken to Jean-Kevin, hasn't it? He misses you a lot you know..."
Where is the chick?
"I saw your latest quiz results... Maybe you should apply yourself a little more, right?"
Shall we do a little Kanban for egg-laying?
"I'm sleeping, leave me alone... I was just dreaming of a Factory of the future... clean and green."
"Lean Management was theorized because of the frustration of Westerners following the worldwide success of Toyota. Jealousy, idea theft, a thriller as we like it."
You are aware that clicking on me brings you nothing? That's what we call Non-Value Added.
"According to a not very serious internal study, the development of this game has induced the consumption of an average of 30 cups of coffee per day."
I started as a warehouse worker. Now I drive a Pallet truck. I hope to continue to grow!
Our competitors are putting out 20 drones per minute. We are only at 8 at the moment. We'll get there!
"I have an idea to avoid defects related to the stacking of products, maybe lower the maximum work-in-process per pallet?"
"We have concerns, but we have no idea what position. What if we did a VSM?"
How have the changes we've made lately been working? Can't we do a VSM again?
"The Logistician has only picked up a portion of my Finished goods. I think that if we increase their Transported batch Size, the Logisticians will have fewer trips to make."
I don't understand why Logisticians don't take more products on their Pallet trucks. Let's increase the Transported batch Size and we will stop waiting!
"I have seen Logisticians narrowly avoid each other again! Let's review the layout of the stations, there should be no crossings in the paths of the Logisticians."
I am waiting for raw materials to work... We need to increase the Batch Size of Raw Materials and ancillary materials.
"I just had a Collision. More fear than harm thankfully, but it would be nice if I didn't have to run around! Let's review the Assignment of logisticians."
I only work half the time because I'm short on material. Maybe the Logisticians could stop by more often?
There was another Collision of Logisticians just now... How about a Spaghetti diagram to see if the problem is not in the implementation?
It's dangerous here... We should relocate positions so that Logisticians are no longer likely to cross paths.
The Logisticians were dabbling in front of me again earlier. Is there any way they could each work on different jobs?
There are too many products waiting on our Workstations. They pile up and get damaged for nothing... We should lower the maximum work in-process per Pallet.
There is a lack of information on what we do. Not easy to know what to improve in these conditions! What if we set up Indicators to follow the production?
How about moving the next workstation closer to mine. Wouldn't that be more efficient?
We should move my position closer to the one before me. It would be faster!

We don't have much information about what's going on on the order side. What if we set up a Kanban?
The order in which I paint my drones is not the same as the order in which Logisticians pick them up. We should implement a FIFO by installing dynamic racks.
We produce far more drones than the customer demand. We should slow down our production.
We should have Kaizen meetings from time to time. It allows us to think together about a given problem.
"We should implement a product mix plan. I can't handle it all, plus it would certainly save time by reducing changeovers on the fly."
"We haven't touched the painting order of the drones for a long time. Customer orders are never the same, we should adapt a little more."
We should reorganize the way stations are supplied. How about implementing logistics routes?
The Logistics routes are far too close together! I didn't have any products to give to the last round because I had given everything to the previous one. The frequency of the rounds should be reviewed!
I've been waiting for a Logistician for at least 30 seconds... I can't work if I don't have products. The frequency of the rounds should be reviewed.

I feel like one of my tasks is affecting the quality of our files. Can we review my tasks together?
"I spend too much time on certain tasks that seem unnecessary. Quality is good, but over-quality doesn't make sense! Could we review my tasks?"
"I heard that the customer is complaining about the quality of our last delivery. During the last reorganization of tasks, they removed an important task from my house... Maybe that's where it came from!"
"Alert, we have an organizational problem. We had to delete an important task without doing so on purpose! Let's review my disabled tasks."
"I'm slowing down the File Flow because I have way too many tasks. We should think about hiring someone, right?"
"I have heard that other departments are not overloaded. But in my department, I could use some help!"
The Files are piling up on my desk... My process must take longer than the previous department. What if we rebalanced the tasks?
I spend my time waiting... The previous departments seem to be overwhelmed. Maybe I can pick up some of their tasks?

Logisticians bring products to the workstations. A wrong Assignment of logisticians can create waiting times. This is what we will see in this notion.
Look at station 3. The Operator seems to be waiting most of the time... Click on the extension to see his statistics.
Attention: one of your posts has no Logistician assigned! It will no longer be supplied or destocked. Try again!
"One of the stations has 2 Logisticians assigned to it. In this configuration, they can cross each other and therefore risk colliding. Try again!"
Attention one of your Logisticians is not assigned to any position. But you have recruited him to help his colleague. Assign him to one or more positions!
Let's see what this new assignment looks like...
"Good for you! You've hired a new Logistician and by assigning him to position 3, you've debottlenecked the process. This has improved the efficiency of the team without decreasing safety!"
This has improved the efficiency of the team without reducing safety!
"His Occupancy rate is low... Logisticians should supply him more often, right?"
Open the Logisticians tab in the toolbox.
There is only one Logistician in this Factory. Obviously that's not enough! Recruit a Logistician and click on Activate.
"Well, we should be able to cut down on wait times with this new addition. Let's see what the difference is!"
"Ouch, with the arrival of this new Logistician, there was a Collision near the station 1! Look, the Logisticians fell off their pallet jacks and there is even smoke! How to solve this new problem?"
Assignment of logisticians to certain positions? Click here to learn how!
"Each row represents a Logistician. Each column represents a position. By default, all logisticians are assigned to all positions. Check or uncheck each item to change their assignment."
My advice: prioritize job 3 which is waiting more than the others. Activate your new assignment when you're done!
"Hello ! Nice to see you again in the offices of [SCHOOL_NAME]! Here, we're no longer talking about Manufacturing drones, but about Files being processed, and we're no longer talking about Workstations, but about Departments."
"Your Objectives: Ensure that Departments process files in the most efficient way possible. No more unnecessary tasks, no more waste!"
"Finally, some tasks are disabled. This means that they are not currently being performed by the Department. A disabled task is grayed out and is always positioned at the top of the column."
At the bottom of each column is the name of the Department and the total time the Department spends processing the file.
"By deactivating tasks, you reduce the time it takes the Department to process the file. You can thus relieve bottleneck departments and make file processing more fluid."
Look at this task. Does it seem absolutely essential? Let's try to disable it by dragging it to the very top of the column.
"Be careful, this task is locked to this Department! You cannot assign it to another Department. Try to disable it in this column."
"Well done! By deactivating this task, you have reduced the time needed to process a file. You have also surely impacted one of the File's Indicators: quality, and/or customer focus, and/or Department organization."
You can also move a task from one Department to another. Try it with this task!
"Well done! Remember that some tasks cannot change departments, and others have positions relative to other tasks."
"Finally, here is a very useful tool for allocating tasks between departments: Takt Time. Takt Time is the ideal time to process a file in order to respond to a customer's request. Go back to the video in the Resources File to learn more. Click on this button to activate it!"
"Before each reorganization, calculate the ideal Takt Time value and try to keep all columns below this value. Try to move this value a little."
You have completed the Process Mapping functionalities. Click here to validate the reorganization.
All tasks performed by the departments were listed using a tool called process mapping.
"After each reorganization, departments take some time to reorganize."
"Deactivating a task can impact customer focus, file processing quality and/or Department organization."
Be careful not to deactivate essential tasks!
Also be careful not to leave too many non-essential tasks! This can hinder performance and delay delivery to customers.
Now let's put your first skills to the test in a challenge!
The process map is accessible via the Toolbox. Click here to open it.
Open the process map by clicking this button!
Welcome to the mapping of the Customer order process!
Each column represents a Department and the set of tasks it performs. Click on a task to get details.
"Each task always includes a title, a time frame and a detailed description."
Some tasks are specific to a Department and therefore cannot be transferred to another Department. They then have a kind of chain on their sides.
Some tasks are numbered. They are intended to be performed in a specific order.
Welcome back to the benches at [SCHOOL_NAME]! We missed you! Ready for this Green Belt Lean Course?
"In order to spice up the training, we have changed a lot of things! The first new feature is the Customer order."
The next customer order is for 6 drones... Let's wait a bit for the Manufacturing team to make it. I'll pause the game when the customer comes to pick up his order.
The customer will pick up their order in a second. I'll turn production back on so you can watch the order being delivered.
Did you understand the principle? Let's get on with it!
"The next order is for 20 drones. It must be delivered in one minute. Complicated, but doable..."
Customers place orders of different sizes (no kidding!). So you have to be flexible.
Let's see... Ah I see we produced [OVERPROD_DRONES] drones too many for the previous order. That should allow us to deliver this one on time.
"On the other hand, be careful not to overproduce (and therefore over-stock) There it helps, but it also has a cost. You remember, in the 7 types of waste, the most important is overproduction."
We will soon know if we have succeeded in delivering this order... or not...
"A CUI-SANT failure! Logically, with our production rate, it is impossible to deliver all these drones in one minute. No worries this time: the customer is willing to wait another minute."
"You must also be careful not to accumulate too much delay. The other orders are not going to shift, so be careful not to get left behind!"
"You've probably heard the expression ""the customer is king""? In the Yellow Belt Course, we're not going to lie to ourselves, you were the king! As soon as you put a product in inventory, it was sold."
"In this notion, we have seen how the Finished goods gauge and the Customer order work."
"You've seen that it's not always easy to meet the demand. Fortunately, in the next few modules, you'll discover tools to do just that."
"From now on, the customer will order a certain number of products from you every minute. And believe me, he never buys more than he ordered!"
Customer orders are summarized in this new tab. Go ahead and click to discover this wonderful new feature.
"Do you see the 3 orders coming up? The top one is the first to be delivered. See the number to the right of the order? That's the time left to deliver the customer! And for that, you need to have enough Finished goods in inventory!"
Welcome to this notion where we will introduce the Customer order and the Finished goods inventory.
"Until now, drones that arrived in the Finished goods inventory were considered sold and immediately brought cash into the Cash flow."
"Everything that was produced was sold. So there was never any overproduction! And remember, overproduction is the worst kind of waste!"
"From now on, customers will order a certain number of products per minute. Each customer will only buy what he has ordered! So beware of overproduction!"
Customer orders are summarized in this new tab. Click on it to display them.
"You see the 3 orders to come, the top one being the first to be delivered. You see the quantity of drones needed, as well as the time left to deliver the customer on time."
You now know where to view the Customer orders to be delivered.
Now let's see where to view the Finished goods inventory.
The level of inventory of Finished goods is materialized by this gauge: it evolves according to the Manufacturing and the orders. Here your gauge is empty. This means that there are [NOMBRE_PRODUITS_EN_STOCK] products in stock.
The number in the bubble at the top and the white line on the gauge indicate how many drones are needed for the current order.
Don't panic! I'll explain how Finished goods inventory works.
"To help you find your way around at a glance, the gauge takes on 3 different colors:"
"Yellow if there are not enough drones in the Finished goods inventory to fulfill the order in-process. The bubble showing the number of drones to be delivered is red, to let you know that the objective is not reached!"
Green if you have the quantity required to fill the work-in-process order. This time the bubble turns green to indicate that your order is ready!
"And finally, Blue when you have more drones in Finished goods inventory than is needed to deliver the next order."
Let's go back to the customer orders: Customer order #1 is for 6 drones... Let's see if the Manufacturing team is able to produce it in time.
The customer will pick up his order. The team has managed to produce the order on time.
This has resulted in a decrease in the number of Finished goods in inventory by the same amount. Now let's move on to order #2.
Order #2 is for 18 drones. It has to be delivered in a minute. This is going to be complicated... Let's see what happens...
The [OVERPROD_DRONES] drones in Finished goods inventory will be useful.
"Be careful not to overproduce (and therefore overstock). This facilitates the next deliveries, but it has a cost, which weighs on the cash flow!"
"It makes sense, but I say it anyway because it doesn't work like that in the Yellow Belt: the company only makes money once the order is picked up by the customer!"
"Remember, of the 7 types of waste, the most important is overproduction."
"Finally no! You do have up to one extra minute to deliver the order, but the later you are, the lower your customer satisfaction and the more late penalties you incur."
Be careful not to accumulate a backlog because the other orders will not be shifted and you may find yourself overwhelmed.
"In this notion, we have seen how the Finished goods gauge and the Customer order work."
"It's not always easy to meet the demand. You have to be flexible and find the right balance in terms of production. In the next modules, we will discover together the tools to achieve this."
"The state of the inventory of Finished goods is indicated by this gauge: it evolves according to the current order! Here for example you can see that there are [NOMBRE_PRODUITS_EN_STOCK] products in stock, it's the number in the bubble at the bottom right. The number above the line indicates how many drones are needed for the order."
"To help you find your way around at a glance, the gauge takes on 3 different colors: Red if there are not enough drones in Finished goods inventory or if, on the contrary, we have too many Finished drones (overproduction); Yellow if we are very close to having what we need to fulfill the order; Green if we have just what we need for the order"
You have seen how DDMRP works in the video.
Let's see its application in the [SCHOOL_NAME]!
"For now, the game takes care of placing the buffers for you. As you can see, we've mostly put them on the product release pallets!"
"Last thing: in the component command window, a change has taken place!"
"The safety stock column has been replaced by DDMRP buffers! As you will experience, DDMRP is much more efficient than Safety stock to manage your resource purchases."
You now know how to set up DDMRP buffers in the [SCHOOL_NAME]. Now it's up to you!
Let's start by enabling DDMRP.
"For this, go to the Toolbox!"
Activate DDMRP by clicking this button!
"Perfect! As you can see, the component inventory gauges have been replaced by buffers. They will allow you to quickly assess the state of your component inventory."
"Now that you've seen how DDMRP works in the video, let's see how it applies in simulation!"
You may notice that gauges have appeared above some of the posts! These are called Buffers.
We will see together how to read a Buffer and what it is made of.
"Now the production will be managed in Pull Flow, that is to say that the stations will produce only what is ordered by the buffers!"
"Each buffer is divided into 3 colored zones: Green, Yellow and Red, which correspond to inventory states."
"Here you can see the amount of components you currently have in inventory on this item, also called the ""On Hand"""
This number corresponds to the Netflow of the concerned component. It is the most important data that allows you to know when to place an order!
"When your Netflow drops below the green zone, it indicates that you need to place an order!"
Let's see how to place a Buffer command
Click on the item with a Buffer
"Each buffer is divided into 3 colored areas: Green, Yellow and Red, which correspond to inventory states. At the moment the game calculates them for you and they are updated every minute."
"You can now place an order directly from the station! Click on ""Supplier Orders""."
"This is the Buffers Control Panel. It groups all the buffers of your production line. You can access it from the concerned stations, or from the Toolbox!"
"The objective is to place orders to bring your Netflow to the top of the green, for each Buffer."
"The ""recommended order"" indicates the quantity that must be ordered to achieve this."
"The ""Criticality"" also allows you to know at a glance in which zone your Netflow is located for the different Buffers."
Now let's see how it works! Let's place an order for red drones on this Buffer. Follow the recommended order.
Have you noticed? The Netflow of the Stamped Sheet Buffer drops as your order of red Drones increases!
"It's perfectly normal! And that is the principle of Pull Flow. By placing an order for red drones, you pull the entire production and therefore ask for stamped sheets at the relevant station, thus reducing its Netflow!"
"Before validating your order, make sure you are at the maximum on all your buffers!"
Perfect! Netflow are at maximum and recommended orders at 0 for all buffers! You can place your order!
The white bar allows you to see at what stage the inventory is in the buffer. It is updated in real time. Avoid being in the Red !
"Now the order is placed, Click on the order summary"
All the components needed to fulfill your buffer orders have been automatically ordered! You are serene for the next Customer order!
"You now know how to use buffers and manage your production in Pull Flow, it's up to you!"
"There are also buffers for each item. To see them, click on this button to open the filters."
Now click on the DDMRP filter.
In this notion you will learn how to manage material inventories and to place supplier orders!
To begin with: inventory gauges!
...of the price per unit of component
...the number of component units in a delivered batch
...the number of such components currently in inventory
...the number of lots currently ordered
"You can also see the Safety stock: it is used to foresee the variabilities in the orders and avoid being in shortage. The game calculates it for you, isn't it nice?"
"The game also offers you a Recommended Order, calculated from the inventory of finished drones, firm orders and order forecasts. It's up to you to decide whether or not to take it into account!"
You can find the formula for calculating the Safety stock and the Recommended order in the economic data of each challenge (1st tab of the Dashboard).
"Try placing a supplier order. Choose what you want and validate in the process! (Don't forget that the quantities ordered are batches of components, not units of components!)"
All your orders are listed here in the Supplier Orders window.
This way you can see when your inventory will be replenished.
Inventory gauges indicate whether you have enough components to produce the products needed to fulfill customer orders.
You now know how to place a supplier order!
Each gauge indicates how many components you need...
As well as the quantity currently in stock.
"This information is useful for placing orders with suppliers. And to place orders, it's in the Toolbox!"
In this Notions you will learn how to manage Raw Materials inventory and place supplier orders!
To begin with: inventory gauges!
Inventory gauges show how many components you have to produce the different products you need!
"Depending on your Customer orders, you will have to place orders to suppliers to have enough components! And for that, it's in the Toolbox!"
"Click on ""Supplier Orders"" to order Raw Materials."
This table lists all possible purchases.
"For each component, you have the following information: - the time it takes for an order to reach the inventory"
- the quantity of component(s) needed per drone
- the price per unit of component
- the number of component units in a delivered batch
"Click on ""Place a supplier order"" to purchase components!"
- the number of such components currently in inventory
- the number of lots currently ordered
"Try placing a supplier order. Choose what you want and validate in the process! (Don't forget that the quantities ordered are batches of components, not units of components!)"
All your orders are listed here in the Supplier Orders window.
This way you can see when your inventory will be replenished.
You now know how to place a supplier order!
This table lists all possible purchases.
"For each component, you have the following information: the time it takes for an order to reach the inventory"
...the amount of components needed per drone
"The MRP generates new Indicators, therefore new graphics!"
Open the Dashboard so we can see it together.
"For forecasts, the further away the order is, the less reliable the forecast is!"
Please be careful. These forecasts can change at any time.
"That's it, we've covered the Dashboard's new features! Now it's your turn to play!"
Let's start by taking a look at the Cash flow tab.
3 new graphics have been added:
The value of the components in inventory
"Work in-process value, which indicates the total value of work-in-process and components on the production line"
The value of the Finished goods inventory. These 3 graphs are updated with each order you complete! (one bar = one order)
Let's move on to the ERP tab
"As you know, the ERP allows you to see the orders made and the payment details."
But now you can also see your future orders! These future orders include firm orders (corresponding to the frozen horizon of the PDP) and the order forecasts established by the Sales Department.
"Hello and welcome to the Demand Driven MRP Course at MGCM School by 7-Shapes! My name is [TEACHER_NAME], I am an expert in Supply Chain. I will accompany you throughout the course."
"Why implement a Demand Driven MRP methodology? Appeared in the 2000s, this methodology responds to the problems of volatility and uncertainty in the company's environment, what is called the VICA world (Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity)."
That's why we created the MGCM School by 7-Shapes: the first interactive and fun training course on the Demand Driven MRP methodology.
"Through a progressive and interactive learning process, enter the Demand Driven MRP methodology and overcome the challenges of variability."
Let's go for a quick tutorial of how MGCM School by 7-shapes works.
Hi! Here we will learn how to manage the Mix product!
The product mix is the fact of manufacturing different products on a single production line.
"It's called Changeover time. This is the time it takes the Operator to, for example, clean the equipment, tools, change the paint can... and start painting with a new color."
"You have to be careful because the Changeover time is a Non-Value Added (NVA)... The customer does not want to pay for it! If the Delay is high, you must avoid changing series too often to avoid losing time!"
"Speaking of customers, open the Customer orders panel."
"Now that the Factory can handle multiple colors, customers won't mind! There will also be a need for a place in the inventory, to distinguish drones of different colors."
Don't forget that you also have to manage the product mix on the packaging station! You will be confronted with this in challenges.
"Now that you know how to manage the changeover, you only need to learn how to adapt production to customer orders."
"For example, in our Factory, we will now manufacture drones in different colors. Only the paint and packaging stations will be affected by the Mix product."
"We will use the painting station as an example, but the packaging station works in a similar way."
"In the next challenges, to make different products, the stations will use different components. For example, this station has 2 pots of paint of different colors in its inventory."
"As a result, the painted drones are distributed on 2 output pallets, depending on their color."
"But first let's see how to change series, i.e. to change from one color to another! Click on the paint station."
Here is a new interface that allows you to manage the paint change easily.
"Here, it is the red paint that is selected. This means that the station is painting the drones red. Try switching to blue."
"The Operator will finish the drone he is working on, then he will proceed to the color change. It takes a little time to go from one color to another."
Welcome to [SCHOOL_NAME] by 7-Shapes! You will learn the basics of Supply Chain and Lean!
Your primary training tool is a drone Manufacturing Factory. Let's go for a tour!
"Activate the Indicators at the beginning of each challenge. Without activated Indicators, it is impossible to track your Objectives! Open the Toolbox to activate the Indicators."
Choose the Indicators that you think are relevant to activate and validate your choice.
"You can see the evolution of the activated Indicators in the Dashboard. To open it, Click here !"
"You will also find here the Objectives of the current challenge, the successive VSMs you have done... In short, all the information you need to make the right decisions."
Let's go back to the Toolbox to quickly discover two tools that will be useful to you. Click on the toolbox where you will find the parameters you can vary and the lean tools you can use in the Factory.
"To begin with, let's look at the ""Transported batch size"" parameter. This is the amount of product transported from one Workstation to another."
"For example, if you set the Batch Size to 5, the products from the first station will not be brought to the second station until there are at least 5 on the green Pallet (Work-in-process pallet) from Station 1."
"If you set it to 1, the Logisticians will only transport one product at a time from one station to another. Please note that the Batch Size is unique for all stations."
"The last thing is the setting of the Work in-process. In the toolbox, you set the maximum work-in-process per Pallet on a given station. On the other hand, in the Objectives bar, it is the total work-in-process for the whole production."
"Reducing the maximum work-in-process per Pallet often allows to fluidify the production and to reduce the quantity of products and components involved. However, work in-process weighs on the cash flow!"
"So you are looking at a drone factory. In this Factory, the different stations transform Raw Materials and components into Finished goods."
"This concludes our first round of the game. And for the record, you can replay this Notions at your leisure!"
"Production starts at station 1, which bends the sheet metal..."
"... And ends at the packing station, the last step before the drones are taken to the Finished goods inventory."
Workstation operators have a lot to teach you! Go talk to them to find out how to improve. Try talking to one of the Operators by clicking on them.
"The first time an Operator talks to you, he tells you what position he holds. The next few times, they give you valuable information about the problems they see. Doing the Gemba Walk at least once is a must at the start of each challenge."
"When an employee has something to tell you, he has an exclamation mark over his head. Click on it to talk to them."
"In each challenge, you discover a different Factory, with specific tools and Objectives to achieve."
"To track the achievement of Main goals, watch the Objectives bar! The goal bubbles are blue and turn green when one of the goals is achieved."
Hi! We have already seen how to read Finished goods gauges and now you know how to calculate a Safety stock thanks to the video
We have already seen the different states of the Finished goods gauges: - Yellow (not enough drones) - Green (enough to meet the order) - Blue (overproduction)
Now you know how to read gauges with safety stock!
The safety stock must now be taken into account!
"Safety stocks are calculated by default in the levels, and are shown in red on the gauges."
You must fulfill customer orders with minimal use of drones contained in Safety stock.
"If you respond to a customer order, using the drones contained in the Safety stock, the bubble at the top turns yellow."
"So for example, with a Safety stock of 5 and to meet an order of 6 red drones, you can meet it by having only 6 drones in your inventory."
"However, you will be using all 5 drones in the Safety stock, and you will be putting yourself in trouble to meet the next order!"
"In order to respond calmly to the order and to depreciate the variability of future orders, we would have needed 11 drones in stock, i.e. 6 more than the Safety stock limit!"
This way you can deliver the order while keeping drones in inventory!
"Hello and welcome to the MGCM School by 7-Shapes' Flow Management Essentials Course! My name is [TEACHER_NAME], I am an expert in Supply Chain. I will accompany you throughout the course."
"Why study Supply Chain? Appeared in the 90's, this approach has proven its effectiveness within organizations by helping to break down silos for a better Department and controlled inventory."
This is why we created the MGCM School by 7-Shapes: the first interactive and fun training course on the fundamentals of Supply Chain.
"Through progressive and interactive learning, master the fundamentals of supply chain and overcome the challenges of planning."
Let's go for a quick tutorial of how MGCM School by 7-Shapes works.
Work in-process has a considerable impact on a company's cash flow.
Total work-in-process is the amount of in-process parts on the pallets at the workstations.
Hmm... Some products get damaged because of piling up... What if we tried to solve this waste?
Change the max work-in-process here.
"Increase or decrease it as you wish, then click on ""Activate""."
Set the maximum work-in-process/pallet low and observe the consequences of this change.
"Work in-process is way too high, if you ask me... Lowering work-in-process is a powerful way to reduce defects and improve cash flow."
"You've gone a bit far! Sure, you'll reduce defects, but you won't be putting out enough product. Try another setting."
Good! Now watch what happens on the defects and cash flow side...
Good for you! You have indeed reduced defects and improved cash flow by reducing work in-process.
Go to the next step now!
The total work in-process must be adjusted to meet the orders and delays expected by the customers.
Producing too much creates unnecessary work in-process and consumes a lot of cash flow!
"In the [SCHOOL_NAME], to vary the total work-in-process, the maximum work-in-process per pallet must be modified."
This maximum work-in-process/pallet has a default value for all pallets.
"For example, if the maximum work in-process/pallet is 2, after 2 Finished goods, each Operator will wait for a Logistician to recover his output inventory before resuming the production."
"Too much work in-process causes overproduction, in other words the worst kind of waste! It also amplifies quality defects and an increase in process lead time."
Low work-in-process can lead to delays in delivery to customers. It can also increase the number of trips made by Logisticians and potentially increase the number of accidents.
"In this Factory, the maximum work in-process/pallet is 20. Let's see if this makes sense!"
"Now that you know how customer orders work, let's see how to read and understand the information about these orders."
"Start by opening the Toolbox, Indicators tab."
Click on this ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) tab.
There you can find the summary of the old orders. There are already three of them.
Look at the first order. The customer paid 7700€ for 16 drones. Normally each drone brings 1000€. There must have been a problem... Let's see why: Click on the order to see the details.
"Let's first look at the products shipped: there were 16 of them that brought in 16,000€. The order was fulfilled, which increased Customer Satisfaction by 10%."
"Then... Here is where part of the problem lies. There were 4 defective products in the delivered order, so we had to refund them. That's already 4000€ less! On top of that, customer satisfaction dropped by 5% per returned drone."
"Second problem: delays. This order was delivered 15 seconds late. As a result, the customer lost 10% of basic satisfaction, and then his satisfaction continued to drop over time. You should know that the slightest second of delay impacts negatively on Customer Satisfaction, but it also leads to Late penalities which impact the Cash flow..."
"The 4th row shows the storage costs. These are the costs related to the number of drones in overstock. At this moment, we have 19 drones in ""overstock"". At 100€ per drone, it goes up quickly!"
All these costs combined have reduced the revenue of this order from 16000€ to 7700€! Customer Satisfaction is priceless (but customer dissatisfaction has a cost!).
This ERP tool is very useful to understand your mistakes. Let's move on!
The first indicator is the Depth of delay. It allows you to know how much delay the last delivered order had.
"Secondly, there are the Late penalities. This is the compensation paid to the last customer because of the delay on his order."
"Finally: the Customer Returns indicator which shows the number of defective drones returned. The company must reimburse each of them, so it is better to keep this indicator at 0!"
Activate these Indicators.
"The Indicators you need for your Objectives are displayed at the top, as usual. Let me tell you about this satisfaction indicator that works a little differently."
"This indicator is set by default and if it reaches 0%, you are immediately ""Game Over""."
Now open the Dashboard.
Do you see this tab? That's where you'll find the information about the customer order.
"In this notion, we are going to learn how to set up the FIFO method."
"As you can see, the next order is 5 red drones and the next is 5 blue drones. We're going to do red ones first."
"In order for the Operators to put the last product on top of the stack, we will replace the pallets by dynamic racks."
"Thanks to these racks, the logisticians will be able to recover the drones produced first. That is to say, those that are at the bottom of the pile."
"To keep the FIFO method until the end of the manufacturing line, dynamic racks were installed on the stations following the painting station."
Note that there is no need to set up dynamic racks on the stations preceding the painting station since the drones are not differentiated before their painting.
Setting up a FIFO inventory control is especially interesting if you have a product mix.
"Once the FIFO is in place, it appears in the VSM. Let's check it out!"
"The last two items are in FIFO mode. You can see the ""FIFO"" sign between them."
In summary: FIFO is necessary for production to follow the order of orders. But it is not necessary for all jobs!
The Changeover schedule is already in place. Let's see how it is configured.
"The default Batch Size is 2 red drones then 2 blue drones. Since the changeover time is quite long, I recommend making larger batches. Reconfigure the Batch Size to 5."
Perfect. So the station will manufacture 5 red drones first and then proceed to changeover.
The Changeover is over. The Logistician will collect the 5 red drones.
"Ouch! The post produced a blue drone. Since we operate in LIFO, Last In First Out (or LIFO: Last In, First Out), the Logistician took the last painted drones... and thus a blue drone!"
"To remedy this problem, the FIFO (First In First Out) inventory control method must be implemented. This way, the drones will be stored in the order of their Manufacturing."
"You can activate the FIFO method in the ""Products"" tab of the Toolbox."
The implementation of this method costs 500€ and takes 10 seconds.
"In this notion, we will learn how to manage the Mix product!"
A Manufacturing line with Mix product is a Manufacturing line able to produce different products.
"The Time to Change series is a Non-Value Added (NVA). If it is long, it is better to avoid changing series too often!"
Let's open the Customer order panel.
Customers are now ordering red or blue drones. And the Finished goods inventory differentiates well between the two colors of drones.
You now know how to manage the changeover to adapt your production to customer orders.
"Thus, this Manufacturing line assembles drones of different colors. The Mix product takes place on the painting station."
The painting station is now supplied with paint cans of different colors.
But beware! The Operator has only one Pallet for the landing drones of different colors.
"Let's see first how to change series, i.e. change the paint color. Click on the paint item."
"Here, the red paint is selected."
Click to select the blue paint.
The Operator finishes the drone he is working on before proceeding to the color change. It takes a little time to switch from one color to another.
"It's called Changeover time. This is the time it takes the Operator to, for example, clean the equipment, tools, change the paint can... and start painting with a new color."
Identifying and eliminating waste is essential to creating value and improving business performance. This is one of the foundations of the lean philosophy.
"Lean identifies 7 types of waste, or 7 mudas in Japanese. In reality, we also talk about an 8th waste, perhaps the most important one: the untapped human potential."
"It produces 12 drones per minute! You couldn't have guessed it, but that's way too much because Customer Demand is only 6 drones per minute."
Overproduction is often the most costly waste for a company.
"We have observed 3 of the 7 types of waste in DAMNESS: Expectations, Non-Quality, and Overproduction. There may also be waste from Unnecessary Travel, Unnecessary Movement, Unnecessary Work in-process/Stocks, Over-processing."
"The 7 types of waste are: unnecessary transportation, overstocking, unnecessary movement, unnecessary manufacturing steps, waiting time, overproduction, quality problems."
"You can remember the 7 types of waste thanks to the acronym DAMNESS: Unnecessary travel, Waiting, Unnecessary movement, Non-quality, Unnecessary work in-process, Over-production, Over-processing."
Let's see if we can observe any waste in this Factory.
"Check it out! Products are breaking on this station! The stack is too high, and one product broke under the weight of the others."
You can spot the presence of Defects or Non-Quality with this icon.
"Station 2 has no more ancillary material, it can no longer work. We are dealing here with a waste of Waiting."
You can spot wasted waits with this icon.
"Finally, this Factory suffers from a waste of Overproduction."
"Do you know what a ""lean diagnostic tool"" is?"
"A ""lean diagnostic tool"" is used to detect waste and more generally problems."
"You can ""chat"" at any time with an employee. Conviviality at work is always a pleasure... And in the course of a conversation, a problem and an idea for improvement may arise!"
This employee has something to tell you. Click this button!
Interesting feedback.
This is the whole point of the Gemba Walk: to gather concrete information at the source.
"One of these Lean diagnostic tools is the ""Gemba Walk"". It consists of going to the field, where value is created, to question the employees closest to the problems."
"During a Gemba, we usually ask these 3 questions: - what task are you doing? - what problems are you facing? - do you have any ideas for improvement?"
"We listen to what everyone has to say. This way, problems and solutions are identified!"
The Gemba Walk is usually done by following the product path.
"Click on any employee to talk to them, learn more about their work and find out where they are in the Manufacturing chain."
"Click on ALL employees who have a ""!"" above their head. That means they want to talk to you! Use the Pause button if you have trouble clicking on a Logistician!"
"Well done, you've talked to everyone. Now click on item 3 to get his stats and chat with him again."
"Cycle time, OEE, Work in-process... We will see that these statistics are very useful!"
"To improve a process, it may be necessary to recruit."
Let's look at how to recruit a collaborator and assign them to the Department of your choice.
Ready to move on to a new challenge?
The recruitment interface is located in the Toolbox.
Try to recruit a new employee.
"Well, now that we have a new recruit, we need to give him something to do! Let's go to Process Mapping."
You can see the unassigned employees here. Each department has a permanent employee...
"To assign an employee to a position, click here."
Did you see that? The tasks of the Department were automatically divided between the 2 employees. But this distribution is not necessarily optimal. It is up to you to reallocate if necessary.
"If the employees in a Department are not busy enough, you can also remove an employee from a Department. Click on the same button."
Don't forget to validate the reorganization before leaving the process map.
"Come on, only"
Indicators to activate!
Indicators to activate!
"If a company wants to achieve its objectives, it must have the corresponding Indicators."
These Indicators allow us to measure where we are starting from and to check if the Objectives are reached or not...
"Very good! We indeed need to enable the ""Manufacturing Drones"" indicator to track the corresponding objective."
"Hmmm, do you really want this indicator? It doesn't fit with any of this company's Objectives."
"Excellent! Now click on the ""Activate"" button and the team will start collecting data."
"That's it, the Indicators are up there. When the objective is reached, the dot turns green."
Indicators are updated every 5 seconds.
You can see the evolution of the Indicators in the Dashboard.
"For example, click on the ""Other"" tab."
"No indicators, no measurement of objectives. Conclusion: to succeed in a challenge, put in place objective indicators!"
"Here we are asked to have a Work in-process below 30. In other cases, such as for the number of drones manufactured, we will need to be above a given value."
"In the [SCHOOL_NAME], there are always 3 Objectives to be achieved. The 3 corresponding Indicators are always displayed here."
"For example, if the Objectives are to reduce the number of Collisions, the indicator ""Number of accidents"" will be displayed here. For the moment, it is inactive."
"There you will find the ""Manufacturing drones"" and ""Total work in-process"" Indicators. Also inactive. Let's see how to activate them."
"Click on the ""Indicators"" icon in the Toolbox."
We will activate the Indicators that correspond to the Objectives of this company.
"Setting and tracking an indicator takes time (and therefore money). My advice: only activate the three Objectives Indicators for this company. Go ahead, activate one!"
"We indeed need this ""Collisions"" indicator which corresponds to one of the Objectives of this challenge. Safety first!"
"Perfect, we indeed need this ""Work in-process"" indicator which corresponds to one of our Objectives."
"Hello and welcome to the Yellow Belt Course at [SCHOOL_NAME]! My name is [TEACHER_NAME], I am an expert in Lean Management. I will accompany you throughout the course!"
"Why implement a ""lean"" approach? Invented by Toyota in the 1950s, this approach has proven its effectiveness in a world of constant change, where competition is fierce and Customer Demand changes very quickly."
This is why we have created [SCHOOL_NAME]: the first interactive and fun Lean training!
Our mission: to make you an actor and a facilitator of your company's performance!
"Through progressive and interactive learning, master the lean mindset and meet the challenges of the organization of the future!"
Let's go for a quick tutorial of how the [SCHOOL_NAME] works!
Hello and welcome to the [SCHOOL_NAME] demo!
The purpose of this demo: to discover the different types of modules of the [SCHOOL_NAME].
"The 5 types of modules are: interactive Notions, mini-games, real-time 3D game-based challenges, videos and quizzes."
"Notions, mini-games and videos are learning modules. The challenges are modules for experimenting with this learning. And the quizzes allow you to verify that the learning has taken hold."
"In our Course, we make sure to mix these modules to vary the pleasures!"
Let's go for a taste of [SCHOOL_NAME]!
Hello and welcome to the Green Belt Course at [SCHOOL_NAME]!
"In this Green Belt Course, you will discover how to adapt production to customer demand (Kanban, Mix product, SMED, FIFO, MADC). And how to lead your team (AIC, Kaizen meeting)..."
Our mission with this Course Green Belt: to make you one of the pilots of the performance of your company!
"The Lean Green Belt is often the leader of the company's continuous improvement projects. If necessary, he is managed by the company's Black Belt."
"As you probably know, this Green Belt Course is complementary to the Workshops that you must complete to have a full Green Belt level (knowledge + skills)."
Let's go for about 7 to 10 hours of Green Belt Course!
Hello and welcome to the Green Belt Office Course at [SCHOOL_NAME]!
"In the office world, one of the challenges is to smooth out the work between departments."
There is a tool that is particularly well suited to do this: process mapping.
"Do the gemba, the red-green analysis, distribute the tasks between the Departments and recruit if necessary to reach the Takt Time...."
Here's what you'll learn in this Green Belt Course.
"But before attacking this part of the Office, a little review of the Yellow Belt Course."
Hello and welcome to the White Belt Course at [SCHOOL_NAME]!
"In this White Belt Course, you will discover the main principles of Lean..."
"...learn how to use your first tools, and perform 2 first diagnostics."
Our mission with this White Belt Course is to open your chakras and show you the power of Lean!
And maybe you will want to pass your Yellow Belt level to be able to actively participate in Lean Workshops?
Let's go for about 2 to 3 hours of White Belt Course!
"The objective of a Kaizen meeting is to find solutions as a team, with the employees who are on the ground."
"Since they are the ones who usually encounter problems, they are in the best position to solve them."
"This solution is indicated by an icon on the corresponding tab of the Toolbox. In addition, this implementation will be less expensive. Isn't that great?"
"For your information, employees go back to work on their own at the end of a Kaizen meeting."
"Last but not least, if you need to pause production so as not to produce more than necessary, you can do so by clicking this button!"
Enough talk... Let's get down to business!
"With their help, we will identify problems and find appropriate solutions."
"During a Kaizen meeting, all employees are gathered to discuss. Production is paused."
"Let's see how to start a Kaizen meeting in the [SCHOOL_NAME]! Open the ""Planning"" tab of the Toolbox."
"Activating a Kaizen meeting is free! And in addition, the improvements that will come out of the Kaizen meeting will cost 500€ less than usual."
"Click on ""Activate"" to see how it works."
Operators and Logisticians finish what they are doing before rejoining the meeting.
Here they are all together. The collective intelligence is on the move! Ideas for improvement will come out of this meeting and will allow to improve the performance of this Factory.
Operators and Logisticians described their problems and proposed a solution.
"In this notion, we will discover how to set up a Kanban."
"As you saw in the video, Kanban is a method of managing production in Flow that allows you to limit the production of an upstream job to the exact needs of the downstream job."
"Same thing on the left, but this time we find the products in entry. The orange cards indicate their number!"
Let's take a look at the VSM to see how the Kanban displays. Open the Dashboard.
"See the little ""K"" between your posts? That's a sign that Kanban is in place!"
Perfect! Now you know how to implement the Kanban method!
"To set up a Kanban, it's this way."
"Setting up a Kanban costs 500€. Go ahead, click on ""Activate""."
"It will take 10 seconds for the company's employees to reorganize themselves following this change. You're used to it, we wait a little."
"There, the Kanban is in place! Look at the signs near the machines, those are the Kanban signs."
Click here to see what the labels say.
This option will allow you to see the information contained in the Kanban.
"By the way, Kanban in Japanese means label. We use cards."
"In this part, you can find information about the products leaving the station. The blue cards represent the maximum work-in-process and the green cards the quantity of products currently out."
"In this notion, we will discover a new way to supply the stations: the Logistics routes."
"Logistician collision risks can be difficult to avoid, even after a successful relocation."
To take care of a station means: to bring Raw Materials or ancillary materials to it and to recover its products from the exit Pallet to take them to the next station.
"Logistics routes go from station to station in the order of production. Therefore, it is important that the shifts are well laid out to avoid Collisions."
"Since we only have one tour, we will leave it assigned to all the stations. Now validate the change."
As usual there is a 10 second reorganization time.
"Here is your first tour! It consists of a motorized vehicle with a first pallet attached to it, which is used to transport work-in-process products between two stations."
"Then comes, if necessary, a Pallet for each Raw Materials or ancillary material."
"Lastly, colored flags are usually placed next to the Workstations to indicate which rounds will be coming to them."
Look at this red flag. It indicates that the red tour is going to take care of this position.
That's it. We have done the tour of the main principles of Logistics routes.
"Logistics routes are the solution! They are also known as ""milk runs"" or ""component or constituent delivery"" (MADC)."
"A Logistics route is the ideal route that a Logistician takes to supply as many stations as possible in the shortest possible time. It is also called MADC for ""Component Delivery""."
Open the tab dedicated to Logisticians!
"Now you can choose between the ""Pallet truck"" or ""Logistics route"" mode. Change the mode by clicking on the radio button!"
"You can decide how many rounds (and therefore Logisticians) are needed, but only one for now."
This is the timer that lets you decide the pace of the tours. Set the first tour to start at the 15th second.
Well done! So you've set the 1st round. It will start every minute at the 15th second. Now let's see the route that the Logistician will take every minute.
Here you can choose the items that each tour will take care of.
"In this notion, you will discover a tool that allows you to automate the changeover of series."
This is the tool: product mix planning.
"Let's see now how to change the Batch Size of the Mix product. Click on the ""change"" button!"
"At the moment, the painting station is doing batches of 2 drones per color."
"Producing as many red drones as blue drones is a good match for Customer Demand. On the other hand, we spend too much time making changeovers. Can you change the Batch Size of the series to correct this?"
"With these changes, more of one color is produced than the other. This will generate overstocking since the customer wants the same number of each. Can you try again?"
"Even if we lose less time in changeovers, we risk overproducing, because we produce more drones than the customer buys from us. Can you try again?"
"With this changeover, we'll be wasting time doing changeovers even more often. Can you try again?"
"Well done! Since we change colors less often, we lose less time and since we produce as many copies of each color we avoid overproduction!"
The paint station's changeover time changes with each challenge. Use the EPEI method to determine the correct Batch Size for each run.
You have just learned how to use the product mix planning tool. Choosing the right Changeover cycle will be very important in the challenges to come!
It is located in this new tab of the toolbox.
It takes 10 seconds to set up and costs 500€ per minute. Activate it!
Observe the consequences of placing this tool on the painting station. Click on it.
The Changeover window has changed.
These dotted lines indicate the Batch Size of each series.
"By default, the Batch Size of the series is 2 products. This means that the paint station makes a batch of 2 red drones and then switches to a batch of 2 blue drones, and so on."
"If you need to change the color quickly, you can change it manually here."
The Changeover time applies each time you change colors.
The Spaghetti diagram allowed us to highlight implementation problems.
"To solve these problems, the location of the Workstations must be changed."
"Beware, there are still crossings in your layout!"
Hmmm... Surely you can reduce the distance the product travels.
Hmmm... Your machines are not well oriented. Turn them by clicking on the arrows.
The moved stations stop working for a few moments during their move.
The relocation will reduce travel.
A good Relocation will improve safety and production speed!
"This is called: doing the Relocation. Attention, you can only relocate if you have made the Spaghetti diagram of the current implantation."
Click on the mapping tab.
"Click on the ""Relocation of stations"" button."
"Look, machine 1 is in red! Indeed, this one is too close to the wall... Move it to a more appropriate place."
Relocation eliminates crossings of flows to reduce the risk of accidents for Logisticians.
Relocation also reduces the total distance traveled by the product.
"Improve the layout of this Factory! When you think your Relocation is at its best, click on ""Activate""."
Your Relocation is invalid: you have at least one machine in red! This means that its position is not possible.
Doing the Spaghetti diagram consists in tracing the physical flow of the product.
The Spaghetti Flow is particularly useful for detecting transport waste and collision risks.
Click here for more information.
The product flows are shown by the blue lines and the ancillary material flows by the pink lines. You also have the distance traveled.
You can switch from one Spaghetti diagram to another with this button.
Have you noticed that the layout of the stations is not optimized in this Factory?
"It's a good thing, you will be able to relocate the Workstations in the Relocation module!"
"To build a Spaghetti diagram, click on the Flow mapping icon in the toolbox."
Click here to start the trail.
"Generally, a plan of the Factory seen from above is used to draw a Spaghetti diagram."
"Draw the path that the product travels. Click on the ""Raw Materials inventory"" (it flashes) and then click on item 1."
"Good for you! Continue like this until you reach the Finished goods inventory to get the total distance traveled by the product. Then click on ""Activate""."
"Congratulations, you have made your first Spaghetti diagram!"
"Be careful, the gemba walk must always be done before building the Spaghetti Flow. Indeed, the gemba is necessary to know the position of the Workstation."
"Each trail is stored in the Dashboard, click to open it."
"In a previous module, we started the data collection by activating the Indicators."
"All this data is stored in the Dashboard, which also contains the challenge objectives and economic information of your Factory."
Here you can see the evolution of the cash flow throughout the game.
"Now click on the ""Safety"" tab."
Here you can see the evolution of the number of accidents of Logisticians per minute...
"...and here, the number of Logistician Crossings per minute. A Collision happens every 2 Crossings!"
"Now click on the ""Production"" tab."
Here you can see the quantity of products manufactured...
...and there the damaged products during the process!
Feel free to come back here regularly to see how your data evolves!
"Now click on the ""Others"" tab."
Here you can monitor the total Work in-process of the production...
"Thanks to the Dashboard, you can make analyses in order to make the right decisions."
And there the Lead time of the products...
...scroll down with the mouse wheel or use the vertical bar on the right to see the employee Well-being graph.
"You can also find the VSM and the Spaghetti diagrams in the Dashboard. We'll see them later, I promise!"
My advice: look at the Dashboard regularly to see the evolution of key Indicators.
"But be careful, a company cannot be driven by indicators alone... It is essential to go out into the field to discuss with the teams!"
Click on this button to open the Dashboard.
"This tab contains the ""Objectives"" to be achieved in the current challenge."
This is the Main goal... necessary to win the challenge!
...and here are the Secondary goals. Essential to get 3 stars in the challenge!
"Now click on the ""Cash flow"" tab."
Here you will find the revenues and expenses that impact the cash flow...
...such as the selling price of a drone and the different expenses of the Factory.
"In this module, we will talk about the importance of finding the right Batch Size."
"There are 3 different batch sizes: Logistic batch size, Production batch size, and Transported batch size."
Observe the effects of such a choice.
"Ouch, another Collision..."
What if we changed the Transported batch Size?
Set the Batch Size in this tab of the Toolbox.
"Change the Transported batch Size to your liking, then click ""Activate""."
so you have increased the Batch Size.
Observe the impact of your changes!
"Accidents have decreased, haven't they? But products are coming out slower... And the risk of defects has increased."
"As far as the Logistic batch size is concerned, my opinion is that it should be maximum to avoid restocking. But beware of overstocking too!"
"With Batch Size, it's all about finding the right balance!"
"Production Batch Size is the quantity of products produced by the Operator at one time. In the [SCHOOL_NAME], the Batch Size is 1 and cannot be changed."
Logistic Batch Size. This is the quantity of Raw Materials or Ancillary Materials transported from the inventory to the relevant Workstation. It can be modified in the toolbox.
Transported batch size is the quantity of product transported between two stations.
"For example, if the Transported batch Size is 4, the Logisticians will wait until one station has produced 4 pieces to transport them to the next station."
"A large Transported batch Size means more products transported at once, but it may also mean more waiting time for the Operators and more risk of defects. On the other hand it means less transport."
"A small Transported batch Size increases the transport time and therefore the risk of Collisions, but it can deliver to customers faster."
"On the other hand, it speeds up the flow of production and therefore reduces the risk of waiting on the Workstation."
"In this Factory, a Transported batch Size of 1 has been chosen."
"In this Notions, you will learn how to move around the Factory and discover the basics of the interface. Moving around is easier with a mouse than with a trackpad. So if you have a mouse at hand, don't hesitate to connect it!"
"What you see behind me is the Manufacturing area of a Factory. Here, and everywhere else on [SCHOOL_NAME], we manufacture drones!"
And here is the pause button! Useful if you need a break. Click on it to try it!
"And there you go, the Factory stops! Practical, isn't it? Especially since you can still walk around the Factory and consult most of the information!"
"Finally, use this button to return to the home screen. Be careful, you will lose your progress on the current level!"
That's it! You have mastered moving around the Factory and the interface! Now we can get to the heart of the matter and start learning about Lean!
Let's try moving around. Hold down the right mouse button (or mouse wheel) while dragging the mouse (or your finger on the trackpad) in the direction of the arrow.
"Good for you! Of course you can move in other directions. Try to see what's going on up, down, left and right."
"To zoom in, scroll the mouse wheel up (with a trackpad slide your fingers up). You can also use the + that appears on the left."
"Good! To zoom out, scroll the mouse wheel down (with a trackpad slide your fingers down). You can also use the - that appears on the left."
Well done! You have now mastered moving around the Factory! Now let's take a look at the interface...
Look at this area. It contains useful information.
This is the time counter! It measures the time you spend in a module OR the time you have left to complete a challenge!
"And this is the Cash flow indicator. Keep an eye on it... because if you go negative, it's GAME OVER!"
The creators of Lean imagined a very useful tool for mapping value flows: Value Stream Mapping or VSM.
"It is about mapping the actions required to transform Raw Materials into Finished goods, at a given time."
"Warning: don't forget to first do a Gemba Walk before building a VSM. Yes, you need to know who is doing what in order to trace the value flow!"
Let's now read our VSM in the Dashboard.
Open the Dashboard.
"Click on the ""VSM"" tab."
Here you will find all the VSMs you have built.
See the arrows? They trace the production flow of a drone from Raw Materials to the Finished goods.
"Each block represents a Workstation. In each block, look at the Cycle time and OEE. Also look at the Work in-process at the entrance and exit of the station on the left and right of each block."
In the center of the VSM you find the number of defects and collisions in the minute before the construction of this VSM.
"Below the blocks, you have the Lead time (min:sec): the time it takes a product to go through the whole process."
"We also indicate in the VSM the Tension Ratio of the Fux, that is to say the ratio of Added Value produced by this process."
Let's start by building a VSM and then we will see how to use it.
You can create as many VSMs as you want and switch between them by clicking on this button.
Please note that only activated Indicators appear in the VSM.
A VSM is very useful to have a global view and to identify the items that slow down the others (the Bottleneck workstation) and those that generate waste!
Feel free to go to the Sandbox to test improvements and see the impact of changes on the VSM.
"Click on ""Build a VSM""."
Here is the VSM builder. Let's start by tracing the product flow.
Drag the 1st item to the corresponding box at the bottom.
Well done! More than

"Ouch, your cash flow is dry! Fortunately, the bank lends you [MONEY_BANK]€. But it is your last chance..."
Last Chance
You do not have enough money to perform this action.
This Factory is perfectly secure. So safety is not an objective to be targeted!
This Factory is not very safe... It is unbearable! The goal of zero Collision is therefore a goal to be achieved.
"The ""number of damaged products / min"" is already at zero in this Factory!"
"Indeed: the ""number of damaged products / min"" is too high in this Factory. Let's set a goal of zero defects!"
You have chosen the wrong Objectives:
"The employees seem to like it here, so the priority is not to further improve their Well-being (although it should be constantly monitored!)."
"Working conditions have a negative impact on employees' Well-being, and this must be remedied."
Work in-process is at its lowest in this Factory. There is therefore no reason to make this a short-term objective.
"Indeed, reducing work-in-process will reduce costs and defects."
The lead time for this Factory is quite short. But it has other problems!
"Good point, the Lead time is too long! It prevents us from meeting customer Delays. So we need to target this particular problem."
"Our ""number of drones manufactured / min"" is already meeting our customers' expectations. There are other more urgent problems to solve..."
"Indeed, setting a ""number of drones manufactured / min"" objective will enable us to meet the delivery delays expected by our customers."
Oh no! Your customers have cancelled their orders because you don't deliver properly!
Game Over! You are short of cash flow!
"You've achieved the Main goal you've been asking for, but you haven't been able to keep your business afloat. What if you started over?"
"Too bad, you didn't pass the Main goal."

The type of cause of the problem is (see Ishikawa diagram) :
The cause of this problem is (see Ishikawa diagram) :
The root cause of this problem is (see 5 Whys):
So we'll have to proceed by elimination to find the one that matches!
No risk on this side.
So what?
"No, none!"
So no worries on the machine side?
I don't think so. But I'd rather you ask him directly...
Mahalia is very cold and tired. Do you think she could have made a handling error?
Good luck for the next step.
Two new causes have been eliminated...
Let's go see Mahalia!
"All right, thanks Soan."
Absolutely!
"Hello again, Mahalia! Do you have a minute?"
"Well, no! My machine stamps perfectly by itself! I'm just here to place the sheet metal and take it out of the machine!"
Excuse me for asking this but... You are tired at the moment... Do you think that you could have made a mistake in handling that would have caused the deformation of the sheets?
"From what I've seen on the deformed drones, the sheets are 8mm while the usual sheets are 10mm! No wonder it's deforming!"
So our last cause is the right one! The problem of deformation of the drones comes from a problem of sheet metal thickness.
"Of course, I feel a little silly for asking you this question! And regarding the thickness of the sheets, do you know anything more?"
No idea!
Any idea why this change in thickness Mahalia?
Glad we're getting to the end of this story! I can't wait to get back to business as usual.
"Thank you very much Mahalia, we have made good progress thanks to you."
"The Ishikawa diagram allows you to identify the cause of the problem! NB: in case of doubt between several causes, the causes can be weighted with figures."
Nour is back and probably has the answer to this question.
"In the next level we will use a final tool to find the so-called ""root cause""!"
That's it! I have the answer to your questions.
"To begin with, no sheet metal is stored in the wet area of the warehouse."
"Ah perfect. Let's see the Ishikawa diagram, so this cause can be crossed out!"
Let's continue!
Oh great! I'm listening.
The supplier had made a mistake in his delivery and these sheets were immediately sent back to him.
What about the sheets stored outside?
"No, sorry... I take care of the inventory. And that's not bad at all!"
Do you have any information about the maintenance of the stamping machine?
"No, I checked with him, no risk there. Logisticians are not allowed to go out with Pallet trucks."
Was the Logistician able to take some of the sheets stored off-site before they went back to the supplier?
No problem. Good luck!
We've eliminated three causes. Let's go back to Soan and see if he has any news.
Thank you very much! We are moving forward thanks to you!
"You're in luck, I have some new information."
Soan? We're not disturbing you?
Any other questions?
"I checked out the new maintenance process for the stamping machine, it is much better than before."
Sorry I'm a bit busy at the moment!
"No problem, I'll come back later."
Hi! Do you need anything?
"Nothing for the moment, thanks!"
Is there anything I can do for you?
"Not for the moment, I will surely come back!"
The cause of our problem is a Matter type cause.
"Now, we will have to understand WHY this cause appeared... To do this, we will learn to use a third and final problem solving method: the 5 Whys."
And why did we use 8mm sheets?
The Logistician made a mistake and delivered 8mm sheets to Mahalia.
"Well, we'll stop at that cause."
Why did the Logistician make a mistake?
These 8 mm sheets were stored with the 10 mm sheets.
"Well, we'll stop at that cause."
Why were these 8mm sheets lined up with the 10mm sheets?
Oh I know! The design office is testing a new lighter drone. They had a sample of 8 mm sheets delivered by our usual supplier. These sheets must have been stored by mistake with the 10 mm ones.
"Well, we'll stop at that cause."
"Okay, but why was this sample put away next to the sheets for production?"
"The design office must not have notified the warehouse. And so when the samples arrived, the Logisticians certainly thought it was a regular batch of sheet metal."
"And since it came from the usual supplier and the difference in thickness was not obvious, no wonder they put them in the same place..."
"Well, we'll stop at that cause."
And why didn't the design office tell the warehouse that they were getting samples delivered?
They must have forgotten...
"Well, we'll stop at that cause."
And why did they forget to notify the warehouse?
Uh... Because they don't have a procedure in place for that?
"Well, we'll stop at that cause."
"The 5 Whys are now complete, it's time to see if you have found the root cause!"
"If you are not satisfied with your 5 Whys, you can restart it by clicking on one of the employees. Know that in real life, you can also go beyond 5 Whys to find the root cause!"
Thank you all for your help!
You will now take this short quiz to see if you have the elements to solve the problem of deformation of drones.
"It's called 5 Whys because it's about asking ""Why?"" five times."
Click here for more information.
You just have to fill in the free fields with the right choices
"Hmm... You might want to reread our results a bit, I think you might have missed something. You can rerun the 5 Whys if you want by closing this window and clicking on an employee!"
"You can try again as much as you want, so don't hesitate!"
Hmmm...you don't seem to have found the solution...You can restart the 5 Whys if you want by closing this window and clicking on a character!
Maybe we've gone too far? You can restart the 5 Whys if you want by closing this window and clicking on a character!
Mhh... I think the type of cause you identified is wrong. Take a look at your Ishikawa!
Mhh... I think the original cause you identified is wrong. Take a look at your Ishikawa!
"Excellent! You have identified the type of cause, the root cause and the root cause perfectly."
...Now we have to discuss with the Design Office and the Logistic about the right process to implement to avoid this problem to happen again.
"Simply put, when you have identified the cause of a problem, you ask the question ""Why did this cause occur?"""
"You have now mastered the trifecta of Problem Solving: 4W1H methods, Ishikawa Diagram and 5 Whys!"
Feel free to replay this mini-game to memorize this super useful methodology!
You can now proceed to the next part of the Course. Good luck!
"Once you have the answer, you ask ""Why?"" again, and so on!"
"By the 5th Why, you usually have the root cause. But you can stop before that. You just have to choose the option ""I found the root cause""!"
We gathered everyone in the meeting room to get the collective intelligence going. Click on one of the contributors to start the discussion.
Hello again everyone!
We are here because we want to understand WHY we have used too thin sheets.
"It is the thickness of the metal sheets that caused the deformation of the drones, right?"
"Absolutely, yes."
"The sheets used were 8 mm thick instead of 10 mm, the usual thickness necessary to ensure the rigidity of the drone."
We found the main cause of our drone warping problem.
Why?
Welcome to the Angouleme Factory at [SCHOOL_NAME]!
Your mission: to help the team solve a problem that occurred a few days ago.
"To achieve this, we will use 3 methods. The 1st method, which allows us to identify the problem, is called the 4W1H methods."
In the previous level we filled in the 4W1H methods form.
You can open it by clicking here at any time!
"The M of ""Material"" refers to all cases related to machines, equipment and maintenance problems."
"The M of ""Manpower"", refers to causes related to human errors such as a lack of competence or communication of teams."
"The last M for ""Material"" will concern, for example, the causes related to the quality of the materials used."
Let's go talk to Soan and fill in the Ishikawa diagram to find the causes of our problem.
Click on Soan to talk to him!
What can I do for you?
This cannot be ruled out... We've implemented new maintenance processes for some machines. Maybe that's where it comes from.
Soan gave us a potential cause.
Click on the cause and drag it to the corresponding branch!
Well done! Let's go back and talk to Soan.
Could the sheets have been deformed on the stamping machine?
You can go see Mahalia. She is the operator of the stamping station.
Who could we ask about this?
I'll stick around if you still have questions.
"Hm... We should continue to discuss with Soan, we are missing information!"
Thank you for this valuable information!
Let's go talk to the rest of the team!
"If the 4W1H methods allowed us to contextualize the problem, we must now find the causes of it."
"Click on the icons at the edges of the screen to move. Mahalia is on your left, but you can also go to Noûr on the right."
"Hi, I'm Mahalia, nice to meet you. Sneeze!"
No indeed... I have a bad cold and it makes me very tired.
You don't look so good...
Yes Soan told me that! It's really annoying this story...
Do you know about this story of deformed sheets?
I don't think so.
Were the sheets damaged when you arrived at your station?
Now that you mention it... Some of the sheets seemed thinner than usual. But I'm not sure.
Have you noticed any other changes recently?
Mmh... I can't think of anything else.
Nour should be able to tell you more. She is in charge of inventory.
Have you noticed anything unusual?
At your disposal.
"Hm... We should keep interviewing Mahalia, I don't think we know everything!"
Thank you for this information!
Click on this fishbone icon!
Let's go interview some more people to fill out our chart!
Hello ! I was told that you would be coming to see me. What can I do for you?
"Yes, I also take care of Raw Materials purchasing. It's a lot of work, but I manage!"
"Hello Nour. You are the Inventory Manager, is that right?"
"Yes, Mahalia and Soan told me about it. But no idea where it came from..."
Ok no worries...
Have you heard about this story of deformed metal sheets?
"We have a few more questions, but we can come back later if you prefer."
"Perfect, we're moving forward."
Thank you for your time!
They are in the Raw Materials and ancillary materials warehouse. Where they belong!
And where are the sheets usually stored?
"We have moisture problems... The building is old, and there are leaks. But I don't think the metal sheets are affected. I'll go check if you want."
We also suffer from a lack of space... We had a big arrival of sheets and it was complicated to arrange everything!
How did you deal with this?
We left a bunch of sheet metal outside for two or three days.
Are there any concerns with this warehouse at this time?
I wish we could do more to reduce our waste... It's demotivating to see how much we suck at this.
"Interesting... But even though Nour talks about demotivation, it doesn't seem to be a cause of our problem. So let's not note this cause in our diagram."
Do you have any other information you would like to give me?
A supplier had delivered us defective sheets... We had to return the batch to them. I'll have to investigate what happened to them...
Do you have another idea in mind?
I present you the Ishikawa diagram or the Fishbone diagram or the Cause and Effect diagram!
Yes indeed!
It would also be worth asking the Logistician what batch of sheet metal he used on the day of the incident?
That way we would be sure!
"Yes, of course."
"It would also be necessary to know how long the sheets were left outside, to see if this could have damaged them."
"All right, I'll check it out as soon as I can."
Anything else?
This diagram is composed of 5 branches (edges) which correspond to the 5 categories of possible causes: the 5M.
I don't think so!
Thank you Nour!
I think we have every possible cause... How exciting!
Now we'll have to sort out and isolate our winner.
This is also known as the 5M method.
"The 5Ms are Environment, Method, Material, Manpower and Matter."
"The M ""Environment"" corresponds to the causes related to the environment of the problem. Such as the temperature or the luminosity in the workshop, as well as the legislation on the product."
"The M ""Method"" corresponds to causes related to the quality of processes or instructions. Such as errors in assembly, choice of material, etc."
Our objective: to obtain the answers to these questions: Who? Who? What? Where? When? How or How much? = 4W1H methods!
Let's take note of the information we already have on the 4W1H methods form.
Place the text in the right category!
Let's resume the conversation with Soan!
I am at your disposal if you need additional information.
Now choose the other questions you want to ask Soan.
I am at your disposal if you need additional information.
"Responsible? And why not ""guilty"" while you're at it!"
"Problems rarely come from deliberate human failures or negligence. Look for the cause, not the perpetrator."
Who do you think is responsible for the problem?
Our 4W1H methods form is incomplete... We need more information if we want to know in which context our problem occurred!
At your disposal guys!
Did we successfully complete our 4W1H methods form?
Thanks for your precious help Soan!
"I noticed the problem this Tuesday, July 16, during the test done around 4:30 pm."
When did this happen?
"After testing a first faulty drone, we tested the afternoon production. The problem is found on 35 drones."
How many products are damaged?
I am the Quality Manager.
What is your function Soan?
Click here to open the 4W1H methods file.
"We test one or two drones at random in each batch. If there is a problem, we test the whole batch."
What are the tests performed?
"Yes, I think it's from the sheet metal. All the drones involved were manufactured from the same batch of sheet metal."
Do you have any idea why the observed deformation occurs?
Yes! 4W1H methods form is completed!
"Thanks to the 4W1H methods, we know the context of the problem."
"To identify the possible causes of the problem (the Why), we will now use the Ishikawa diagram!"
We know that the problem is in the Factory in Angouleme.

Welcome to this red/green analysis mini-game!
"A red/green analysis is used to highlight unnecessary tasks. To perform this analysis, we observe an Operator during a production phase."
"We will ""stack"" the observed tasks in the categories you have chosen."
We start with the tasks that bring Added Value and then we continue with all the waste of the DAMNESS!
The height of the blocks represents the time the task takes to complete. This allows us to identify the most wasteful tasks and the categories to which they belong.
"Now that you know how to read this chart, let's see if you've correctly identified Sophie's tasks."
Excellent! Let's check if you have correctly qualified all the tasks.
It is then determined whether the tasks performed by the Operator have added value for the customer or not.
This is Sophie! Sophie is in charge of assembling the drones. Watch carefully the task she is about to perform.
"If you think the task has value for the client, click on the VA (Added Value) button."
"Otherwise, click the NVA (Non-Value Added) button to indicate that the task has no value to the customer."
Finally click here to review the task.
Choose the category that best fits the task Sophie has just completed.
Perfect! We observed enough tasks to get an idea of the waste that occurs.
The best way to present these results is in the form of a graph.
Red/Green Analysis
Total time
When you identify NVA you must specify the type of waste.
"At the end of the observation phase, this will help decide which improvement to implement first!"
A little clarification: it is important to distinguish between a waste of transport and a waste of movement.
"Waste of motion is when the task is performed within the ergonomic zone of the Workstation (i.e., within a 1 meter radius of the Operator when standing in front of the Workstation)."
Transport waste occurs when the task is performed outside the ergonomic area of the Workstation.
Choose the waste that best fits the task Sophie has just completed.
Perfect! Now that all the tasks are well identified we can see that there is a lot of waste!
The Lean approach consists mainly in reducing these wastes to improve performance. Choose the improvements to be deployed to reduce the NVA as much as possible.
"Obviously, the ideal would be to reduce all waste, but each improvement has a financial and human cost and takes time. It's all about finding the best effort/gain ratio!"
"Among these 5 improvements, choose the one that seems the most relevant to maximize the reduction of waste."
"Click on the ""Validate"" button to apply the improvement!"
The improvement you chose has been implemented! We will reanalyze to see what impact this change has on the VA/NVA split.
Well done! You have correctly qualified this task! And as you can see it is now in the corresponding category!
Keep doing this until everything is properly sorted. It is essential that the analysis phase is good in order to determine what improvement to make next!
"It's still not the right solution! Don't worry, you can try again as many times as you like."
It seems that you have made a mistake in the qualification of some tasks.
"Don't panic, you can view each task and re-qualify it! Click on a task to change your choice."
"Great, everything is well qualified. In the 1st analysis, the share of Added Value represented [X]% of the total production time."
"Thanks to the improvement you have implemented, the Added Value now represents [Y]% of the production time, which is a gain of [Z]%. Congratulations!"
"Now you know how to identify waste and choose the priority improvements to deploy to reduce it, so don't hesitate to use it!"
"If you want to try another configuration of improvements, click on ""One more try!"". Otherwise, click ""Finish"" to stop there. It's up to you!"
Hmmm... Some steps are not correctly qualified... Click on a step to change your choice.
See the improvements
"Want to try a new configuration? Come on, from now on, you are free to choose as many upgrades as you like!"
"To activate or deactivate an improvement, just click on it! When you are satisfied with the configuration, click on ""Validate"" to launch the observation!"
Raised pallets
The entry and exit pallets are raised in order to limit movement and the risk of collisions in the work area. This improvement has an influence on the waste of movement.
Dynamic Rack
The Pallet of ancillary materials is replaced by a dynamic rack which improves the ergonomics on the Workstation and has an influence on the waste of movement.
5S
"The necessary tools are standardized and available directly at the Workstation, which has an influence on the wastage of movement."
Internal quality control
The shell is checked at the previous station to ensure that the input product is 100% compliant with the quality requirements. This improvement has an influence on non-quality and over-quality waste.
MADC
A Logistics route is set up in order to supply the station and recover Finished goods at regular intervals. This improvement has an influence on the waiting waste.
Shower
"The implementation of a handheld scanner (barcode reader) to scan Finished goods allows the automation of Manufacturing reporting, which has an influence on the waste of over-processing."
Improvements
(0/3)
"Your choice is saved! At the end of the analysis, we will see if you have qualified each task correctly."
Let's go back to our analysis. Watch carefully what Sophie does!

Welcome to the Standard mini-game! Your objective is to design a production standard and measure the time and efficiency gains.
"You are a new Operator and your mission is to assemble your first drone. For the moment, you don't have any standard or instructions. Some technical constraints are to be respected, you have to discover them."
"Different parts, divided into yellow boxes, are needed for assembly. Click on the part of your choice, position it on your Workstation and click again. A blue silhouette and a green tick will appear if you have chosen the right part..."
... or a red cross if it's not the right one! It's up to you to find the right assembly sequence. Good luck !
"Good! The assembly of the drone is finished. Things could have been much easier with a production standard! No? Let's move on to the creation of this one. Meanwhile, I'll do some 5S to improve your work envionment."
"To create this standard, simply click on the pieces, which will appear at the bottom of your screen. A new step will then be automatically created. It is up to you to put all the pieces in the right order."
"Psst...a little technical advice: For the engines, put them in the order M1, M2,... same for the propellers: H1,H2,... A standard can only do us good!"
"Great, the standard is finished! The order of assembly is respected and you have even taken into account the advice and experience of your collaborators!"
"While I was at it, I took the opportunity to tidy up the Workstation. Now let's see if your Standard is working. Click on ""Start"" to start a new assembly."
"FYI: The boxes are now arranged in order of use, from left to right and top to bottom, and your Standard is now displayed on the right side of the screen. All you have to do is follow the steps and take the right parts to assemble. And off you go!"
"Congratulations! Thanks to the Standard, you have completed the assembly of the drone with fewer errors and faster. You have won! [TIME]."
Creation of a Standard form
"Strange! You took longer to assemble the drone, despite the implementation of the Standard and the 5S... Voluntarily or not? I invite you to try again!"

Welcome to the SMED mini-game! You are about to learn how to identify and optimize the different steps of a Changeover in our paint shop. The Objectives? To reduce this time as much as possible in order to have the most flexible production tool possible.
"We have just finished painting a blue drone. To change series, follow the ""To Do"" list in order"
"To perform a task, click on the ""+"" icon..."
"... but be careful, some items are necessary to perform an action. They will be in your inventory, at the bottom of the screen"
You now have everything you need to get started. It's up to you to find the first action to perform. Be careful! The clock is ticking!
"You are about to make your first action. For this one, a menu appears on the right with specific interactions."
"For this type of interaction, please read the associated paragraph to realize them!"
"Changeover of series completed! As you can see, it took a long time. Now let's see how to apply the SMED method to reduce this time."
This first step allowed us to calculate the total time to go from one series to another. The second step of SMED is to categorize these tasks: are they currently internal or external? It's up to you to make the right analysis
"Let's move on to the third step: outsourcing internal tasks. Objectives? Outsource as many tasks as possible in order to reduce internal time. Take some hypotheses, and imagine which tasks should be outsourced. It's up to you!"
"Step four: Reduce internal task time (your future changeover time), by implementing improvements."
Let's move on to the fifth and final step: reduce external tasks in order to reduce the total time to change series!
"With our 7-Shapes working group and your help, here is the list of improvements to implement and investments to make. We let you discover them!"
"You have just applied the SMED methodology from start to finish. With all the improvements you have implemented, let's now see how much time we have reduced that changeover time."
"Comparing the results before and after, we can see that the time saved is substantial! This Workstation is now much more flexible and this is a gain for the workshop and the whole Flow."
Summary
2/5 Categorize tasks
3/5 Outsource the internal
4/5 Reduce internal
5/5 Reduce external
Improvements
"When changing series you have done all the tasks yourself, machine stopped, so all are in the category ""internal""."
The shutdown of the compressor could be automated with specific equipment.
An automated machine would allow the gun to be washed when not in use.
"By automating the washing process, there would be no need to collect a new, clean gun."
"By automating the washing process, there would be no need to install a new gun"
The paint supply of the station could be done in an automated way
The paint could be supplied already pre-mixed
"The Operator, to work on the drone, must recover it himself in the rack. But this is still an area for improvement!"
"It is possible to set up pre-set automated systems, so that the Operator does not have to do it"
The Operator must paint the drone himself
"It is possible to optimize the deposit of the painted drone in the rack, but this remains an internal task"

Everything is going well (SECURITY)
"Oh I'm at the painting, so little risk!"
"Indeed, you have to go there to get hurt!"
"Don't think so, there's a reason you have a mask. No sore throat?"
"You never know, it may not necessarily come from your job directly but from the surrounding area."
Haha! It is sure!
"No need to check, there is no risk at the painting station"
"No, everything is fine on this side. Our protective masks have high performance filters."
"Yes, but the safety zone is well defined, no risk there."
The safety protocol is well applied around the painting station
No itching from paint particles that might be airborne?
Do you remember to change the mask filter regularly?
"No more, my outfit protects me completely!"
The safety protocol is well applied on the painting station
"Yes yes, I am careful, there is no risk on this side."
The Operator at the painting station applies the safety instructions
Everything is going well (STAFF)
"Oh it's ok, not much to do"
"Really? We have a delivery this week, have you finished yet?"
"Oh well, good for you!"
"Uh, if you say so..."
No workstation for painting
And you just waited without doing anything?
How come? You are not supplied?
"Without paint, you can't work. Just keep waiting for your job to be filled."
"Well, I went to look in the inventory, but there were none left."
"No, since a few days Felix does not come to supply my post anymore"
"Well, okay..."
"Well, if there are no more, that's that. We have to wait until we order new paintings."
But isn't there an inventory?
You can go get the paint yourself instead of doing nothing.
"Yes, it's normal, he was assigned to another workshop. I'm going to find out why we don't come and supply your station."
"Okay, that's not right, I'm going to have a word with Felix about this."
Ok well I'll wait then.
"I don't know, usually when I go to get some, there is inventory"
"Oh, I didn't know it was my turn to do it..."
"Oh well, that's why... So what do I do in the meantime?"
"It works, maybe it's still on break!"
Need to order more paint
The operator of the painting station is not autonomous
Felix doesn't do his job
You go and get the paint yourself? Nobody brings it to you?
"So when you take from the inventory, you don't notify anywhere what you are taking?"
I'll check with Logistic to get you emergency supplies so you can work.
"You wait for a Logistician to arrive, they must have assigned you someone else"
"Yes, but when the Logisticians don't bring it to me, I go and get it myself"
"Uh no, I'm not aware of what to do in the inventory."
"Ah thank you, this will help me a lot."
"Well, okay..."
Operators do not know the inventory processes
The painting station must wait for the painting
You don't want to do that. I'll see why the Logisticians don't always supply you
I'll see what I can do for the Logisticians. In the meantime keep picking up inventory when you need it.
Any idea how to prevent this from happening again?
I'll let you know as soon as I know more. See you later
Understood.
"Oh well, okay."
It would be nice to have an assignment schedule per production line to be aware of and react faster I think
"Okay thanks, see you later!"
Logisticians have not stocked the paint station. Operators are not allowed to go into the inventory
Logisticians are not working well. In the meantime the operators are allowed to go into the inventory
The problem of paint supply must be solved and a schedule of allocation by production line must be made visible to the teams
"There is a problem with the supply of paint, I will see to solve it."
Everything is going well (QUALITY)
"Nothing to report. The new paints dry faster, it's much more pleasant."
Very good. Hi
Glad to hear it. Have these new paintings changed your process?
Glad to hear it. Is the paint still the same shade as before?
See you later!
"No, I always do the same."
"Yeah, I didn't see any difference, and I know what I'm talking about, I've been seeing this paint for 10 years."
There are no safety issues at the stamping station
The new paint matches the old paint
Okay fine.
"Anything else to report, whether it's during set-up or clean-up?"
Cool!
"Ah well, now that you mention it, I have the impression that the spray guns are more complicated to clean. , You'd have to change the product to clean the spray guns."
The new paints do not seem to change the process of the job
"The guns are complicated to clean with the new paints, I'll ask to adapt the cleaning product"
Everything is going well (SECURITY)
Yes it can go
"Can it go ? Well, that's nice !"
I saw that a safety issue was brought up in your post. Can you tell me more about it?
What's going on?
"Yeah, nice..."
"Oh great that you mention it! , Well yes, I almost had my hand crushed!"
I don't feel that the safety standards are well enforced
Ah well! Could you explain how?
"Yes, this is a common problem in the industry. We have to be careful to apply them properly"
"Yes, this is often the problem. You have to deal with it."
"Well, it took me a while to get my hands off..."
Mmhh... okay
"Well, okay... until the day when..."
The Operator indicated that Safety standards were not well enforced. We will be careful.
"Operator doesn't feel safe, you have to deal with it."
We'll have to practice to be faster. It would be silly to lose a hand
There is no automatic safety system?
"Okay, so it's my fault..."
"Yes, but it doesn't seem to go off every time. As I had to keep on producing, well, I did as I could..."
Operator almost gets his hands crushed because he's not fast enough.
"You did the right thing. Production doesn't have to stop, you just have to be careful."
"It's still dangerous, we have to fix it quickly. I'm going to call in Maintenance and you're going to move to a different job in the meantime."
"I'll see if Maintenance can come fix your machine. In the meantime, be careful where you put your hands"
Got it! I'll be careful
I don't want to lose my hand!
Got it! I'll be careful
I told the Operator that Production is more important than Safety
"I notified Maintenance of a safety problem on the stamping station, in the meantime he continues to work on it"
"I'll let you know when the problem is resolved. In the meantime, go see Eric to get you assigned to a position in the meantime, you can't continue on this one"
Would you have any ideas for improving safety in your position in the future?
Thank you! One less stress!
Preventive Maintenance can be set up to detect this early.
The Operator is assigned to a secondary position while Maintenance fixes the safety problem on his position
I sent Maintenance to the stamping station. In the meantime he will work on another station. We will schedule regular maintenance in the future to reduce this kind of risk.
Everything is going well (STAFF)
Just a few small delays but everything is running smoothly
What does that mean? What's going on?
"Ah well, if it's just a matter of small delays, no worries."
There is a new temporary worker in the cutting room but nothing serious
"Oh well, cool then."
The stamping station has some minor delays
"Yes it's normal, it takes time to train."
"He's in training right now, do you see a problem with the organization?"
Aren't temps always the problem?
"Yes, we've all been there."
"Not necessarily, I just think it's the time he's used to the production"
"Uh, no... It seems a bit rushed to me. Anyway..."
"The interim is not fully operational, but it will be soon"
"Unsurprisingly, an interim is still not up to par"
"Well, it will settle down when the temp gets used to it."
Do you think it needs a few more days of training?
"Yes, that's it"
Maybe a little because it seems to be already put in autonomy but it was not briefed on everything
"Thanks for the heads up, I will inform his trainer to make sure he is up and running quickly!"
"Yeah, well, too bad... He'll learn as he goes along."
Great! Thank you!
"Well, yeah, it's not very cool for him."
"The temp still needs a few days of training. , I will inform his trainer so that he can be autonomous quickly."
"The temp is not yet perfected, but never mind."
Everything is going well (QUALITY)
"All is well, RAS"
No change in your work habits?
Does the sheet metal look the same to you as usual?
"Well listen, if everything goes well, it's perfect!"
"No, I'm doing what I always do. Is there a problem?"
"Well, they seem to be a bit lighter and more flexible but I didn't have any problems with the stamping"
Yes!
"Over-quality at the stamping station, no need to check"
It was reported that the frames were breaking more often during assembly. I was wondering if this could be due to the stamping of the sheets
"No, just checking to see if you are doing your job."
"Yes, so they are not as usual you could at least indicate that!"
We changed suppliers so do not hesitate to go back up if you have a problem with the sheet metal.
"I have not changed anything in my way of working, it must come from somewhere else."
"Ah well, long live confidence!"
"Uh yes, but it didn't change my process..."
"Okay it works, thanks for the info!"
More fragile drones don't come from stamping
I don't know if the Operator at the Workstation is doing his job right.
The operator of the stamping station does not report the problems
"The sheet metal change did not impact the workstation, he will keep us informed if it impacts his workstation."
Everything is going well (SECURITY)
"Yes it's ok, I just don't know where the earplugs are"
You can ask your colleagues where they got theirs
"Really? Didn't you already have some? , If not, they are in the PPE room"
And you're waiting for me to come to you to take care of it?
"I'll do that, thanks."
"No, I didn't need it, but they moved my workstation while I was away and I'm now next to a much noisier one"
Let's just say that I didn't need it before...
The operator of the assembly station will ask his colleagues where the earplugs are
The Operator for the assembly is not very pro-active
"Yes indeed, we needed to move your position."
"Okay, we took the liberty of putting your station here, to reduce travel. Is it okay if we provide you with your own plugs like for the stamping station?"
You thought we were in a massage parlor? It's normal that there is noise.
"I've seen it, feel free to tell me about it before next time."
"Yes no worries, I have no problem with the location, just the noise. , So if the problem is solved I'm ok!"
"Wow nice. Well, I'll go with that."
Notify operators when changes are made
The operator of the assembly station cannot stand the noise
Great! Do you have any ideas on how to make other posts not have this problem?
"Very good, everyone is happy like that."
Perhaps a dispenser could be installed at the entrance of the workshop or each operator could have his own custom-made caps
"Yes, thank you!"
"Ensure that each employee has custom-made earplugs, and add a dispenser at the entrance of the line in case of forgetfulness"
"The stamping station is noisy, it is necessary to provide plugs to the surrounding stations, especially the assembly station"
Everything is going well (STAFF)
"It's ok, I just came back from sick leave."
"You are often absent, aren't you?"
"All right, are you well?"
"Well, not more than anyone else I guess?"
"Yes thanks, I'm fine, just in my absence some organizational points were changed and I didn't know"
Monitor the assembly station. Operator may be faking sick.
And why didn't you know? You should have known when you got back.
Which points exactly?
I'll be careful next time
"Oh part of the morning stand up meeting was at 9:15 instead of 9:45 and I wasn't kept informed, I missed it this morning"
"Supervise the operator of the assembly station, he doesn't seem very invested"
You should still keep up with the changes when you're away.
"Okay no worries, do you think we could fix this so that no one forgets?"
"Well, now you know, that's the main thing!"
Ok I thought I would be warned...
"I think we could just put a small sign at the entrance of the workshop, and then we have to anchor the routine"
"Indeed, I'm not likely to forget anymore."
The assembly station operator is late for meetings
"It is necessary to provide a display with the information affecting the line of prod, visible by all to avoid misunderstandings"
The Operator is now aware of the new organization
Everything is going well (QUALITY)
Uh...I've had better days
"It's not easy every day, take heart."
What's going on?
"Yeah well, it happens, stop complaining and work a little."
Yes thank you ...
That's two broken hulls today!
"Well, great empathy."
The Operator does not seem to be in good spirits
Operator complains for nothing
Did you raise your concern?
Yes I have seen an increase in the last few days. Do you have any idea where it's coming from?
You should be more careful in your work.
"Not yet. I think I've found the cause, but I'd rather be sure before I tell you."
I haven't changed my way of doing things but the hulls seem more fragile
"However, I am always so careful."
Operator is not very conscientious in his work
"You should have told me about it as soon as it happened, we don't ask you to think about it"
It's important to warn when it happens. What are your first guesses?
"We changed suppliers, but do you think that's where it could come from?"
Maybe the humidity at the moment is a factor
"All right, next time I'll tell you directly. In any case, you know about it now. No need to talk like that."
I feel like the clink is thinner than it used to be but I'm not sure yet. I was going to talk to my colleague to see if he noticed anything
"I know, but at least since Felix has been managing the supply of sheet metal, he finds it a lot lighter."
Uh maybe I don't know
Operator broke drones without reporting the problem
The sheets seem more fragile. Perhaps the humidity in the air?
"He's not very smart, I don't think he notices anything"
We did change suppliers. I'm going to see about getting the quality of the sheet metal checked.
Do you think Felix could be the cause of this problem?
Ok I will ask to check the quality of the sheet
Wow..I hope you don't talk about everyone like that...
I will be careful until I know if I need to change my process.
"No I don't think so, Felix is very careful, there is no reason for him to be the cause."
"Okay, I'll continue in the meantime?"
"The Operator at the stamping station is not very smart, he may be the cause of the sheet metal problem"
The quality of the sheets from the new supplier seems inferior
The problem of more fragile drones does not come from Felix
"Yes, being careful, do you have any idea how to prevent this from happening again?"
I think you can. Make sure you break as little as possible.
Could we implement a more thorough quality control of Raw Materials from suppliers?
"Of course, I will be careful."
"The new sheets are of poor quality. A better quality control should be implemented, I will check with the Department in charge. I'll also check with the supplier"
"The new sheets are of lesser quality, it is necessary to change supplier"

Project review and new product launch
"Assignment of logisticians is important. Instead of each logistician being assigned to any workstation, the logisticians will be assigned to specific workstations. In this way, crossings can be avoided, and therefore collisions between vehicles. A Logistician assigned to a shift is responsible for collecting the outgoing products and taking them to the next shift. The Logistician also supplies the station with Raw Materials or ancillary materials if needed. Example: I assign a Pallet truck to station 2 which has an inventory of ancillary materials. This Pallet truck will therefore bring ancillary materials when this station needs them and will also take Finished goods from station 2 to bring them to station 3. On the other hand, it is the Logistician assigned to station 1 who will bring the input products from station 2."
Assignment of logisticians:
"The supplier order allows you to place orders for your components. For each component you can find out how long it will take the supplier to deliver it to you, how many parts of that component are needed to manufacture a drone, its unit price as well as the minimum number of parts you can order each time. Furthermore you can find information about your current inventory and if you have Safety stock planned, you will get a recommended order."
Supplier order
"DDMRP (Demand Driven Material Requirement Planning) is an innovative, multi-level ""pull flow"" methodology for inventory and material planning that allows a company to align itself more closely with market requirements and prioritize execution and planning more quickly and smoothly. DDMRP was introduced to the world through the book ""Orlicky's Material Requirements Planning"", third edition revised by Carol Ptak and Chad Smith."
The DDMRP
"By default, the factories at [SCHOOL_NAME] operate in LIFO (Last In First Out), meaning that the last product in is the first product out. This is because the agents and Logisticians stack the drones on pallets, and they retrieve the ones that are on the top of the stack, i.e. the last ones to arrive. This system does not cause any problems as long as there are no perishable products or changeovers brought about by customer orders., For the FIFO system, we install dynamic racks that automatically bring down the products and allow us to retrieve the lowest products first, i.e. the oldest ones. Implementing the FIFO system allows us to keep the production order established by the changeover of series and therefore to respond to customer demands as planned."
FIFO (First In First Out)
"The indicators are updated every minute and are used to retrieve information throughout the production process: - The manufactured drones indicator counts the number of drones in good condition shipped to the customer - The damaged products indicator calculates the number of defective products - The accidents indicator counts the accidents - The work-in-process indicator corresponds to the products currently in the production line., - The Well-being indicator counts the state of well-being of employees based on a mix between performance and quality of communication in the Factory - The Lead time indicator calculates the total manufacturing time of a product"
Indicators:
"The maximum WIP per pallet is the maximum number of products allowed on a pallet at the entrance of a station. If the maximum WIP is reached, no Logistician will supply this station until its inventory is empty. On the output pallet of a station, if the maximum WIP is reached, the station will stop producing until a Logistician has picked up the products. A low WIP allows to fluidify the production line in case of fluctuating customer demand. Be careful not to have too little work-in-process, otherwise the stations will not be sufficiently supplied."
Maximum stock per pallet:
"Kaizen meetings are meetings to solve a problem in a process or to improve it. The entire team comes together to discuss a problem and see how to effectively address it. No one knows the problems in the field better than the people who work there, and in the factories of [SCHOOL_NAME], this results in a production stop. All employees participate in this meeting during which the costs of improvements are reduced by €500."
Kaizen meeting
"Kanban is a visual organization method. It is a card system that allows to produce at the Customer Demand. To do this, we install a panel with cards on each station. This one represents what the station must produce in relation to the maximum work-in-process. If the maximum work-in-process is 8, the station will have 8 cards on its panel. Each time it produces a drone, it puts a card on this drone. If the station has no more cards on its panel, it must stop producing. As soon as a Logistician picks up drones, he has to replace the cards attached to those drones, on the post's panel. Thanks to this system, the post knows how much it has to produce and when to stop."
The Kanban
The Logistic batch Size is the number of Raw Materials or ancillary materials that the Logisticians will retrieve from the inventory.
Logistic batch size
"Changeover planning is a method that automates changeovers. It allows you to schedule series based on customer orders, without having to worry about changing series on the fly."
Planning of Changeover series
"The number of Logisticians is important. The more Logisticians and Pallet trucks you have, the faster the products will be transported and the less time the stations will wait. On the other hand, more Logisticians means more Collisions if your production line is not well organized."
Logisticians and Pallet trucks:
Glossary
The Spaghetti Flow is the tracing of the product's path through the production line. This allows you to see if the path is optimal and to see where the Logisticians are crossing.
Spaghetti diagram:
"Transported batch size is the number of products that Logisticians carry between each station. A smaller batch size means more trips for Logisticians, but it also means that the production line is smoother and the stations have less waiting for material or work-in-process."
Transported Batch Size:
"Relocation involves drawing a Spaghetti Flow diagram, i.e. the new organization of the production chain that we would like to put in place. This allows us, before launching the reorganization, to see the best organization that we can put in place."
Relocation:
The VSM (Value stream mapping) is a tool that allows you to see the entire path of the product in the production chain. You can see each step as well as the information concerning each of them.

I have a problem when I try to buy a license pack...
"Whatever the problem, don't hesitate to contact us: contact@seven-shapes.com We are here to help you!"
"I would like to have a version of the {{BASE_SCHOOL_NAME}} that better corresponds to the activity of my company, how can I do?"

"We would love to make this possible! In the meantime, feel free to write to us to support your need for a ""custom simulator"" at: contact@seven-shapes.com 😉"
"If I want a specific feature that is not currently in the game, how do I do it?"
Contact us: contact@seven-shapes.com. We welcome all feedback from our users!
I can't connect...
"If you can't log in, it's probably because the password you entered is wrong. Check the password you used and the email address ;) If needed, you can also reset your password, but be careful: the code generated in the email you will receive is only valid for 48 hours!"
"Someone registered me on {{BASE_SCHOOL_NAME}}, but I didn't receive a confirmation email..."
"There are several ways to help you: - Look in your spam folder, our email may have been sent by mistake! This one is sent by the address : contact.school@seven-shapes.com :) - Try to do ""forgotten password"" with your email, if it is well registered in our database, you should be able to receive a new email ! - Contact the person/entity who gave you access to a license to make sure that he/she has registered you in his/her structure - If all that does not work, contact us at the address : contact.school@seven-shapes.com"
I can't register on school.7-shapes.com
"In this case, you must first make sure that:<br/>- You have typed identical passwords, to help you, you can click on the eye present on the side of the field: this will allow you to see it in full<br/>- You have typed your email address correctly<br/>- You have filled in all the requested fields, they are mandatory :)<br/><br/>If the problem persists, write to us at: contact.school@seven-shapes.com"
I am a professional and I would like to pay by a means other than credit card.
"No problem! Contact us at: contact@seven-shapes.com, we will get back to you as soon as possible :)"
"My card payment worked, but I did not receive an invoice!"
"If the payment worked, you are supposed to receive an invoice by email, but maybe it arrived in the spam? If this is not the case, you can always find your invoice in the ""management"" -&gt; ""my orders"" section. If, by misfortune, none of these solutions allows you to have your invoice, do not hesitate to contact us : contact@seven-shapes.com so that we can solve the problem and issue you one :)"
The code I sent when I created my account does not work...
"The code sent when you created your account is valid for 48 hours for safety reasons. To receive a new one, you just have to ask for a change of your password on the homepage of the site: school.7-shapes.com. A new email will be sent to you with a valid code and you will be able to login easily!"
"I can't change my email, why and how can I do it?"
"You can't change your email because your account is directly linked to it. We can change it for you! To do so, please write to us: contact.school@seven-shapes.com so that we can answer your request."
What will I learn at {{BASE_SCHOOL_NAME}}?
"If you have already visited the ""pricing"" page of our website, you know that we offer several packages, including a free demonstration package. Each offer corresponds to a Lean Belt: White or Yellow. There are stand-alone courses and a tutored and certifying Yellow Belt course (the SPOC: Small Private Online Course). We are working on green and black belt versions and also on business offers: lean office, lean Logistic etc..."
Are your training courses leading to a certificate or diploma?
"At the moment, we have <a href="""">a Yellow Belt certification</a> Course in the form of a 100% online training course lasting 4 weeks. This training allows you to take <a href="""">the Yellow Belt - Lean Six Sigma certification</a> registered with the RNCP (Répertoire National des Certifications Professionnelles)! The other training courses offered with {{BASE_SCHOOL_NAME}} are not certifying. However, they provide knowledge and enable you to obtain a level equivalent to White Belt or Yellow Belt in Lean Management."
Should I follow the order of the Notions and Challenges?
"Yes, you have to do the Notions and challenges in the order they are presented. However, there is an ""unlocked"" mode accessible in the ""Options"" menu of the game which allows you to access any level of the game. Be careful though, your progress is not saved in this mode."
"I am a trainer, a consultant, can I use {{BASE_SCHOOL_NAME}} as a course support?"
"Of course it is! Professors use the game in various ways to teach Lean principles: - By giving access to the game to their students before the class so that they can have a basic understanding and know the vocabulary. By explaining the principles of Lean using the game to simulate the notions, then giving practical work or homework exercises with the challenges contained in the game., - By proposing exercises on paper such as ""make the diagnosis of this Factory"", ""make proposals for improvement for this Factory"" using the ""sandbox"" mode of the game. To help you in the creation of your Course around the game, we have produced materials to help you: answers to the challenges and educational exercises to go further. You can also ask us, we can help you in this process!"
Does the game install on my PC?
"No, everything is available directly online, all you need is an internet connection and a compatible web browser: Chrome or Firefox."
Can I play on a tablet?
"It's not possible yet... But if you insist, we'll get to it!"
"My game doesn't work, what can I do?"
"Your browser may be the cause of the problem: the game is not compatible with Internet Explorer, Safari and Edge. Try with Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.<br/>Otherwise, don't hesitate to write to us at this address: contact.school@seven-shapes.com explaining as precisely as possible what is wrong.

"I have an ""Out of Memory"" problem, what can I do?"

My speciality is more specifically on the processes of consumer goods in continuous series. I formalized my field knowledge of Lean through the 7-Shapes training.
